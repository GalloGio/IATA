        Picklist component used only in flows. It allows to have a picklist with dynamic values.
        The standard picklist component in flows is not dynamic (you have to define the choices). 
        Because it's not possible to have an attribute of type "Object", values of the picklist has been concatened.
        The concatenation of the picklist values is a semi-colon of the value colon the label.
        Example value1:label1;value2:label2;
