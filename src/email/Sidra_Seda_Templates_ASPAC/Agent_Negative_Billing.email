Dear {!Contact.Name}

Greetings from IATA!

Our email is regarding the agency's negative billing for the period XXXXXX of agency code {!Account.IATACode__c}. To enable us to refund the credit billing to the agency, this office would require bank beneficiary form duly filled and signed by a senior authority as per the format attached. 

The bank beneficiary name of the account holder should match the legal name of the agency registered with this office for us to accept the same. 

In addition to the above, we would require a copy of bank statement of the account or first 2 pages of the Bank pass book whichever is available. 

The bank mandate should reach us no later than XXXXXX <Date>. In absence of Bank beneficiary form by the stipulated date, a credit memo will be issued to the agency in the next available billing.

We request you not to make any manual adjustments in the next remittance as the credit billing funds will be refunded to the agency based on the Bank beneficiary details provided if found in order or through credit memo.


Please do not hesitate to contact us in case of any questions.


Thank you. 

Best Regards,
