Dear {!Contact.Name} 

Greetings from IATA. 

Our email is regarding over remittance of {!Case.Currency__c} {!Case.Outstanding_Amount__c} received from the agency for the period {!Case.Remittance_Period__c}. 

As per our records, the agency has overdue invoices XXXXXX and XXXXXX for total value XXXX pending for payment. Accordingly, the over-remittance is being adjusted against these pending invoices.

For the balance amount of value {!Case.Currency__c} XXXX, this office will be issuing a credit memo (SPCR / BTA) and this will be included in the agency's billing for period i.e. XXXXXX. 

Please note that your next remittance to IATA will need to be as per the IATA billing statement. Manual adjustment of this credit during the time of your next remittance will not be accepted. 

For any clarification / assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us. 


Thank you. 
Best Regards, 
{!Case.OwnerFullName}
