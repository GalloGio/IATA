Dear {!Contact.FirstName},
Thank you for contacting our customer service. Your new Customer Portal password can be found below.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your participation in our Customer Portal pilot project. In order for the Customer Portal to be successful, it has to meet the needs of our customers. Your feedback is thus important to us and we kindly ask you to submit any feedback using the ‘Ideas’ tab in the portal.

Once again, thank you,
