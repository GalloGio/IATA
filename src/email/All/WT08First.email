Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I would like to keep you updated that IATA will be on world tour this summer and will be covering destinations such as Dubai (UAE), Macau (China), Denpasar (Indonesia), Mumbai (India) and Tokyo (Japan). In October we visit  Brazil & Mexico (Americas). 

These regional events will attract 60 to 80 top industry leaders across the aviation value chain. 

Kindly let me know, should this present as an interesting opportunity in terms of sponsorship.
 
Thanks and Regards,
