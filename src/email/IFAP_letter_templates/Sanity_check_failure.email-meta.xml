Dear {!Account.Name},

Following the upload and submission of your financial documents to IATA, we have been advised that below documents are invalid, incomplete, or missing:

- &lt;INPUT THE REASON FOR SANITY CHECK FAILURE, AS PROVIDED BY THE GFA&gt;

A complete set of valid financial documents must be uploaded and submitted on the IATA Financial Assessment Portal:

http://www.iata.org/ifap

Your Username and password for the Portal remain as previously communicated.

Deadline for submission: &lt;INPUT THE SAME DEADLINE DATE AS PER THE IFAP CASE&gt;

Please be reminded that a failure to submit your financial documents by &lt;INPUT DEADLINE DATE&gt; will mean that your Agency no longer satisfied the financial standards as published in the Travel/Cargo Agent Handbook, and actions will be taken in accordance with the applicable resolution.

For any queries on this matter, please contact us at http://www.iata.org/cs and refer to your case number: {!Case.CaseNumber}

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,
IATA Operations &amp; Service Center</textOnly>
