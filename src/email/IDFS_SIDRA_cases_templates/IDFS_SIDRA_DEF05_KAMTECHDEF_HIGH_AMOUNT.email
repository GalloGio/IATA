Dear Stakeholders,

DEFAULT DUE TO ACCUMULATION OF IRREGULARITIES 

Our records indicate that {!Account.Name} has incurred an accumulation of instances of irregularities during the last 12 months.

Consequently, in accordance with the provisions of the IATA rules, the Agency Administrator shall take default action against {!Account.Name}.

Unless we hear from the Agency Administrator to the contrary, we assume that there is no objection proceeding with the application of the mandate by COB today.
