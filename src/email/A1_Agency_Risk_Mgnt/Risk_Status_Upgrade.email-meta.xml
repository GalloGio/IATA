    <textOnly>Dear Agent,

We would like to inform you that according to our records one or more risk events that were previously registered under your risk history have recently expired.

This brings your risk information to be updated as follow:

Risk Status: {!Account.ANG_RiskStatus__c}
Cash conditions limited to Financial Security: {!IF(Account.ANG_CashCondition__c, &apos;Yes&apos;,&apos;No&apos;)}

For more information about risk management, please do not hesitate to contact us via the IATA Customer Portal.

Best Regards,
