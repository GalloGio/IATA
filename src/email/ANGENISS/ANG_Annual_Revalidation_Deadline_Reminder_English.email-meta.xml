    <textOnly>Dear Sir/Madam,

Our records indicate that your agency has still not validated agency details stored by IATA through the Annual Revalidation process in accordance to Resolution 812 Section 3.2.4.1

Consequently, in accordance with the provision of the IATA Passenger Sales Agency Rules and Resolution 812 Section 3.3.2.1, an Administrative Non-Compliance has been registered to your agency and an administrative fee will be charged to your agency, according to Resolution 812, Attachment H.

Please validate your agency details through IATA&apos;s Portal at your earliest convenience.

Failure to complete the Annual Revalidation process by final deadline indicated in initial notification sent will result in immediate removal of Electronic Ticketing Authority and a Notice of Termination of your Passenger Sales Agency Agreement.

We trust that you will give this matter your immediate attention.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any queries on this matter via our Customer Service Portal at http://www.iata.org/cs.



Yours faithfully,



Agency Management
International Air Transport Association
