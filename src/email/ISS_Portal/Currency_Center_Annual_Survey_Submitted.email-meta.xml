    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name}

We would like to thank you for participating in the RFB Survey.

You will find attached the RFB Report {!YEAR(TODAY())} with the industry findings and focus for this yearâ€™s advocacy efforts for currency repatriation.

We will continue to engage with our Members facing repatriation issues on a monthly basis to keep track of the progress and development and support the advocacy actions.

Should you have any queries, please log a case in your IATA Customer portal under the topic &quot;&quot;Currency Center&quot;&quot;

Kind regards,
Currency Center Team.</textOnly>
