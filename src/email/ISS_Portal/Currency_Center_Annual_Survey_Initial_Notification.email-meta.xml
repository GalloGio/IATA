    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

Your Annual Survey on the Remittance of Foreign Balance for the year {!YEAR(TODAY())-1} is now open.
 
Note: Participation to the RFB is required to access the IATA Currency Repatriation Monthly Report.

As every year in February, IATA Currency Repatriation collects data for the year-end edition of the Survey of Remittances of Foreign Balances (RFB). In order to determine the industry-wide amount of blocked or delayed sales funds in and from countries that are subject to currency and repatriation restrictions.

With your help, the ITWG (IATA Treasury Working Group) committee will regard these countries as part of the mandate scope to facilitate repatriation for the airline industry worldwide. 
Please keep in mind the following when completing the survey: 
Please respond even if your airline has no blocked or delayed funds, as this will still be valuable information with regard to the industry&apos;s overall situation, and it will also entitle you to receive a free copy of the RFB when completed.
Please report countries were you are facing repatriation issues : Funds blocked due to lack of foreign exchange or reasons beyond airline&apos;s control.
You can use the Other Countries of Concern section to report countries where repatriation although is possible requires cumbersome procedures, high costs or where difficulties of communication with the relevant authorities are faced.
It is important that you include all the details requested, please note that this data is then aggregated with other airlines facing issues in the same market to have an industry picture. This data aggregation is essential for our advocacy efforts and meetings with authorities such as the Central Bank. You will also receive the aggregated data for your own internal discussions and analysis.
Part of these details is to indicate any amounts held with ICCS and avoid mount duplication as ICCS data is already accounted for in the aggregation exercise.
If you do have blocked or delayed funds, please use the comment box to include a brief description of the problem you are facing.
Funds that do not fit this description include: funds blocked due to reasons specific to your airline only (e.g. due to the airline&apos;s staff, GSA or auditors’ actions) or due to the bankruptcy of the airline’s bank.
Note that all individual airline data will be kept confidential.
I am looking forward to receiving your response no later than the 15th of March {!YEAR(TODAY())} and I thank you in advance for your assistance with this matter. 
If you are not the correct contact within your airline to answer the survey, please pass this email on to the appropriate person. 
Your input is greatly appreciated.

Should you have any queries, please log a case in your IATA Customer portal under the topic &quot;Currency Center&quot;
Kind regards,
Currency Center Team</textOnly>
