Dear Sir/Madam,
Under the provisions of the IATA Resolutions, all Approved Cargo Agents/Intermediaries should continue to meet at all times the requirements and criteria set forth in Program Handbook to ensure retention as an IATA Cargo Agent/Intermediary.

In accordance with IATA Resolutions, your Company is required to have full-time employee(s) holding a valid Unit Load Devices (ULDs) certificate if you are handling Unit Load Devices (ULDs).

Please send evidence/copies of Unit Load Devices (ULDs) certificates of employees, or a non-handling declaration to indicate that your Company is in compliance with such requirement.

The above requested certificates should be sent to IATA through our Customer Service Portal web page: http://www.iata.org/cs to arrive no later than {!AMS_OSCAR__c.Change_effective_as_of__c}. Please attach a scanned copy to case {!AMS_OSCAR__c.Name} visible on your portal home page under ‘My recent cases’ section.

The Agency Administrator will carry out a review, and make a decision based upon the evidence available. Therefore, in your own interest, please give this matter your immediate attention.

We would appreciate your acknowledgement of this letter and confirmation that you will give this matter your immediate attention.

Kindly ignore this letter if you have already actioned on it.

Yours faithfully,
Agency Management
International Air Transport Association
