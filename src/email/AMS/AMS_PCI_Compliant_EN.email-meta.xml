    <textOnly>Dear Sir/Madam,
Under the provisions of the IATA Resolutions, all Approved Cargo Agents/Intermediaries should continue to meet at all times the requirements and criteria set forth in Program Handbook to ensure retention as an IATA Cargo Agent/Intermediary.
In accordance with IATA Resolutions, your Company is required to have at least two full-time employees holding a valid Dangerous Goods Acceptance certificate issued within the previous two years to provide the services and handling functions described in the Handbook.
According to our records, Dangerous Goods certificates provided by your Company will expire on {!AMS_OSCAR__c.Change_effective_as_of__c}.  Therefore, please send evidence/copies of new and/or updated Dangerous Goods Acceptance certificates, together with any other information you feel may have a bearing on your qualifications, to indicate that your Company is in compliance with such requirement.
The above requested certificates should be sent to IATA through our Customer Service Portal web page: http://www.iata.org/cs to arrive no later than {!AMS_OSCAR__c.Change_effective_as_of__c}. Please attach a scanned copy to case {!AMS_OSCAR__c.Name} visible on your portal home page under ‘My recent cases’ section.
The Agency Administrator will carry out a review, and make a decision based upon the evidence available. Therefore, in your own interest, please give this matter your immediate attention.
We would appreciate your acknowledgement of this letter and confirmation that you will give this matter your immediate attention.
Yours faithfully,
Agency Management
International Air Transport Association
