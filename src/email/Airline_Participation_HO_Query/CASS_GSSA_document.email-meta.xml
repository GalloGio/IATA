Indeed, you are currently an active participant in Cargo Account Settlement System (CASS), governed by Resolution 851.


As per IATA Resolution 851 and in order to be able to participate in CASS, General Sales and Services Agents (GSSAs) are required to complete and sign a Counterindemnity Agreement and a Form of Application and Concurrence for each CASS operation.


According to our records we have no such documents for your Company in our Archives, and therefore we have contacted you through our Local IATA Offices to request the same.


So far we have not received the requested

- Counterindemnity Agreement

- Form of Application and Concurrence


And hereby request your Company to sign these documents as part of the requirements to participate in the following CASS operations:

Kindly complete the form (s) with your Company Legal Name and full address of the registered office. Please print two copies.


Both copies should be signed by your Airline Senior Management, either Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or Director General, and sent to the address indicated below. IATA will send return one original for your archives, after countersignature on our side.


In the case that the documents are not received within the indicated time frame, IATA will suspend your participation from CASS pursuant to Section 14 of Resolution 851 until the above mentioned documents are received.


Please contact us at +41227702983 for further queries.
