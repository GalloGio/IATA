    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

Kindly note any change in the bank account instructions must be requested by the participant at least 15 days in advance. The implementation of such instructions can only be considered as valid by the participant when acknowledged by IATA, including the settlement date in which the new instructions will be effective. Until such confirmation, please ensure that you current account remains active.


The local bank account mandate is available Here.



Kindly note the bank mandate must be issued from your Company’s Head Office and signed by two Head Office senior officers, at least one of which must be:



• Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or

• Head of Treasury or Cash Management Department


The original document should be sent to IATA Geneva on the following address:



Airline Participation

International Air Transport Association

33, Route de l&apos;Aéroport

1215 Geneva

Switzerland

Ref nr {!Case.CaseNumber}



Please be advised that should you provide us with a bank mandate, we will be running a Penny Test when updating the bank details, therefore please provide the applicable contact persons details who will be accountable to provide us the penny test&apos;s confirmation. A Penny Test is when IATA will proceed with a settlement of 1 penny (or 1 cent, depending of the market) to the airline&apos;s new bank account and track the payment with the Clearing Bank. Once we run a successful penny test, the new bank account would be used for the next potential airline&apos;s settlements. Such process will bring more security for the airlines&apos; financial and cash flow availability.


Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.


Kind Regards,
