Please note the conditions applicable for the multi-country deal:


- The basis for qualification for a multi-country special price is to implement CASS in a minimum of 10 operations;


- The  special joining fee applied under the multi-country deal offers a 40% discount over the full joining fee, as follows:

o for IATA Member: USD 1,500 per operation;

o for non-IATA Member: USD 2.100 per operation


- An implementation schedule for each operation, as well as a local contact (to handle the CASS joining process with our local Cargo Managers) must be provided to IATA. In case the Airline wishes to appoint a GSA in that market for sales and marketing purposes, the GSA contact must be provided;


- The CASS implementation must be completed within 6 months of the multi-deal acceptance by IATA, as per the implementation schedule defined at the time of the acceptance of the CASS multi-country deal.


- This  special rate  is only valid if all countries listed by the Airline are implemented within the agreed period of time. Otherwise IATA reserves the right to invoice the full joining fee amount at the end of the originally planned go live period. This will be applied in all countries comprised in the Airline’s request.

Please confirm your acceptance of the conditions outlined in this communication. In order to formalize the multi-country agreement, please provide us with the following information:


- Local contact for your Airline: name, title, telephone  and email address

- Implementation schedule for each CASS

Once we have received this information, IATA will issue a letter confirming the acceptance of the deal and proceed to charge the corresponding joining fees. In case your Airline is an IATA Clearing House Member, the fees will be processed via ICH, otherwise, a pre-payment advice is issued and a bank transfer is necessary to settle the joining fees.
