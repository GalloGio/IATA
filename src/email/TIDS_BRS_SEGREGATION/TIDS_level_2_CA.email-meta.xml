    <subject>Segregation of TIDS Branches from IATA Agency Code_{!Account.IATACode__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>{!Today}



IATA Numeric code: {!Account.IATACode__c}

{!Account.BillingCity}, {!Account.BillingCountry}



Dear {!Account.Name},



On 26 March, 2018, New Generation IATA Settlement Systems (NewGen ISS) Resolution 812 will become effective in {!Account.BillingCountry}. This new Resolution covers the Sales Agency Rules under NewGen ISS and introduces a new program that will modernize the BSP to better address the needs of the travel industry, providing travel agents with more choice and flexibility[1].


In order to deliver the full benefit and value of NewGen ISS to the Travel Agency community, the need to align with the provisions of the Resolution 898 and separate the Travel Industry Designator (TIDS) completely from their Travel Agency Head Offices has been identified.

According to our records, your Agency has been allocated TIDS codes as Branches to your Head Office holding the IATA code {!Account.IATACode__c}. [2]



In order to align with the provisions of the Resolution 898, effective 21 March, 2018 your TIDS codes will be separated from your IATA Agency code and converted into either of the following options:


Option 1 - A standalone TIDS Head Office
Option 2 - A TIDS hierarchy consisting of one TIDS Head Office and the remaining TIDS as Associated Branches linked to that TIDS Head Office.


In order to facilitate this compliance process, please provide us with the following information by 20 March, 2018:



I. Your preferred option as indicated above (Option 1 or 2)

II. The TIDS code you wish to select as the TIDS Head Office (in the case of  Option 2)

III. The contact from your existing contacts details to be assigned to the TIDS Head Office as we may need to contact your TIDS standalone Head Office directly. Alternatively, you may provide a new contact with a unique email address.

If the above required information is not received by 20 March, 2018, this will result in the conversion of your TIDS codes into a TIDS hierarchy, where the Head Office will be randomly chosen by IATA from your current active TIDS codes.


Once NewGen ISS is effective, IATA will provide Agents with a choice of the following new Accreditation types:


GoLite Accreditation (Standard Accreditation with no Cash Facility)
GoStandard Accreditation (Standard Accreditation with Cash Facility)


Your TIDS locations are welcome to apply for one of these accreditation types once NewGen ISS is live in your respective BSP market, or else remain as separated TIDS locations.

The accreditation of your TIDS locations under any of the Accreditation types will be subject to compliance with the applicable IATA Accreditation criteria and termination of their TIDS codes as they will be assigned IATA codes.

If you apply within 90 days from the Go-Live date of NewGen ISS, the accreditation of any of your TIDS locations will be at no additional cost. To start with the process, you can contact IATA through online customer portal www.iata.org/cs.

If you have any queries, please log your enquiry via our Customer Service Portal (www.iata.org/cs) and our Customer Services team will gladly assist you.

Yours sincerely,

IATA Global Delivery Center
