    <subject>Segregation of TIDS Branches from IATA Agency Code_{!Account.IATACode__c}</subject>

Dear {!Account.Name},


On 01 April 2018, New Generation IATA Settlement Systems (NewGen ISS) Resolution 812 will become effective in {!Account.BillingCountry}.This new Resolution covers the Sales Agency Rules under NewGen ISS and introduces a new program that will modernize the BSP to better address the needs of the travel industry, providing travel agents with more choice and flexibility[1].

 

In order to deliver the full benefit and value of NewGen ISS to the Travel Agency community, the need to align with the provisions of the Resolution 898 and separate the Travel Industry Designator (TIDS) completely from their Travel Agency Head Offices has been identified.

According to our records, your Agency has been allocated a TIDS code as a Branch to your Head Office holding the IATA code {!Account.IATACode__c}.





Effective 02 March, 2018 your TIDS code will be separated from your IATA Agency code, and will be converted into a standalone TIDS Head Office location.

As we may need to contact your TIDS standalone Head Office directly, we kindly ask you to indicate which of your existing contacts details is to be assigned to the TIDS Head Office by 22 February, 2018. Alternatively, you may provide a new contact with a unique email address (by 22 February, 2018).

Once NewGen ISS is effective, IATA will provide Agents with a choice of the following new Accreditation types:

GoLite Accreditation (Standard Accreditation with no Cash Facility)
GoStandard Accreditation (Standard Accreditation with Cash Facility)
Your TIDS location is welcome to apply for one of these accreditation types once NewGen ISS is live in your respective BSP market, or else remain as separated TIDS location.

The accreditation of your TIDS location under any of the Accreditation types will be subject to compliance with the applicable IATA Accreditation criteria and termination of the TIDS code as it will be assigned an IATA code.

If you apply within 90 days from the Go-Live date of NewGen ISS, the accreditation of your TIDS location will be at no additional cost. To start with the process, you can contact IATA through online customer portal www.iata.org/cs.

If you have any queries, please log your enquiry via our Customer Service Portal (www.iata.org/cs) and our Customer Services team will gladly assist you

Yours sincerely,

IATA Global Delivery Center
