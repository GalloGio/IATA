Dear {!Case.Contact}:
 
 
VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION
FAO: YOUR ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT AND DIRECTOR
 
 
 
A recent internal audit outlined that CASS ***IMPORT*** is currently producing invoices to some of your offices showing legal information that differ from your head office’s ones. 
 
On a fiscal and legal standpoint, we can only produce invoices on behalf of airlines and GSAs to companies that have signed an agreement with us, which means the legal name and VAT numbers of your branch offices must be the same as the ones of your head office.
 
As of 12th May 2010, all the invoices produced by CASS will therefore show the information that your agency registered at the time of its accreditation with IATA. 
 
Please pay attention to the following information, that will affect your next CASS IMPORT invoices:
 




Location Type *

Agreement Number

CASS Code

Legal Name as per IATA Agreement

Name displayed on CASS invoices

 (*) HO: Head Office. BR: Branch Office. AW: Air Waybill issuing Office.
 
Any change request should be immediately addressed to IATA through our web portal www.iata.org/customer according to the agreement you signed.
 
 


Should you need any further information from IATA, please do not hesitate to login a new query via our Customer Portal: www.iata.org/customer. These queries will be answered with the highest priority.
 
 
Yours sincerely,
