    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.LastName}
 
{!Account.Name} participates in CASS Switzerland under Agreement number {!Case.IATA_Code__c}. 
 
The review of our database put in evidence that we don&apos;t have any VAT Number for your company. This might affect the correctness of the invoices that CASS issues on behalf of its participating airlines.
 
We kindly ask you to answer to this message by specifying the VAT number of your company. 
In the case that no VAT number has been assigned to the company, please reply saying &quot;NO VAT&quot;.
 
 
Should you need any further information from IATA, please do not hesitate to log a new query via our Customer Portal: www.iata.org/customer. These queries will be answered with the highest priority.
 
 
Yours sincerely,
 
{!Agents__c.OwnerFullName}
