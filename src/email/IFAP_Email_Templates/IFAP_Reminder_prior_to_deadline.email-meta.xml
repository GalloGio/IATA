Dear {!Account.Name},





This is a reminder following our request for your company’s financial documents.



Deadline for submission: {!Case.Deadline_Date__c}





In accordance with the IATA Passenger Sales Agency Rules/Cargo Agency Rules, annual examinations of the financial standing of all IATA Accredited Agents are conducted to ensure they continue to meet the minimum financial standards. These standards are published in the Travel Agent&apos;s Handbook/Cargo Agent&apos;s Handbook.



Failure to submit the financial documents by {!Case.Deadline_Date__c} will mean that your agency no longer satisfies the financial standards as published in the Travel Agent&apos;s Handbook/Cargo Agent&apos;s Handbook.



Please ensure your financial statements are uploaded only through the new IATA Financial Assessment Portal by using following link:

Your Username is {!Contact.Email}. If you are registering on the IATA Financial Assessment Portal for the first time, please go to “Not registered yet?” and enter this email address to register.



Please refer to the FAQ sheet for instructions on how to upload your financial statements and other frequently asked questions.



For any queries on this matter including updating your email and contact details, please contact us through http://www.iata.org/cs and refer to your case number: {!Case.CaseNumber}





Thank you for your cooperation.



Sincerely,





IATA Accreditation
