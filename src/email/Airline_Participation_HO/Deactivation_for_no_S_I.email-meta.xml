    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Name},

&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;

We previously communicated to you the need for [airline name] to formalize its bank account in [BSP or CASS ..........] to allow IATA to settle outstanding amounts in your favor which are currently being held in our Hinge Account.  Because this situation has not yet been resolved we can no longer continue to provide you with settlement services in [BSP or CASS......].


Therefore, with immediate effect, [airline name} is suspended from [BSP or CASS ………] until such time as [Airline name] formalizes its banking situation in [country].  We will be pleased to reinstate [airline name] once bank account information in [country] has been communicated to us.


We will be advising participants in [BSP or CASS] [country] of this temporary suspension.


Thank you for your understanding.
