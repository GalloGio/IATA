Access Granted

Dear {!Contact.Name},

You now have access to the TIDS Virtual Branch Service and may apply for a Virtual Branch under your Head Office {!Account.IATACode__c}.

With a TIDS Virtual Branch, your online business activities can be identified and recognized with a distinct IATA TIDS Numeric Code.

Note that Virtual Branches should not be used to identify physical office locations. For such need, please apply for a regular Branch Office.

To initiate an application for a Virtual Branch, simply access the TIDS Service on the IATA Customer Portal and select &quot;Add a Virtual Branch Office&quot; from your TIDS Head Office Dashboard.

Thank you for choosing TIDS, IATA&apos;s program for standard identification of non-accredited travel sellers.

The IATA TIDS Team
