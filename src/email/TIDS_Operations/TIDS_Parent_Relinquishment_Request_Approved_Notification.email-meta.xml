Dear {!Contact.Name},

The voluntary relinquishment requested for your TIDS Head Office {!Account.IATACode__c} has now been processed.

Your participation to the IATA TIDS Program is Terminated effective immediately. As a result, your agency will no longer be reflected in the IATA Agency List which industry suppliers reply upon.

Please be advised that this termination applies to your TIDS Head Office as well as any of its active branche offices.

If your voluntary relinquishment was submitted in error,  note that you may request reinstatement of your  agency&apos;s participation to the TIDS program, maintaining the same IATA TIDS Code, for 90 days following its termination date. To do so, please use the &quot;Reinstatement&quot; option available on the Dashboard of the TIDS Service accessible via the IATA Customer Portal.

Thank you for choosing TIDS, IATA&apos;s program for standard identification of non-accredited travel sellers.

The IATA TIDS Team
