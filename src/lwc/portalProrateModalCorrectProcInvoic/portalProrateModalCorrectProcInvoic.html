                        Dear baggage claims and prorates officers,
                        <p></p>
                        We would like to kindly remind you about the correct way of invoicing baggage claims:<BR/>
                    
                        <h4>Part 1</h4>
                        
                        In accordance with IATA Reso 780 5.4, Baggage Claims and Proration, a party receiving a baggage claim, and having participated in the carriage of the passenger, will process the claim to a conclusion with the passenger... 
                        When it is established in which airline's custody the mishandling occurred the claim receiving airline will deal with other participating or responsible airline(s)' baggage claim/prorate offices to achieve an agreement for prorate. All necessary supporting documents as per paragraph 5.4.8 should be attached to prorate notice and dealt between baggage claims/prorate offices.<BR/>
                            
                        <h4>Part 2</h4>
                        Unless payment has been agreed by your prorate office you should not make any payment. Payments are automatically agreed if participating or responsible airline(s) fail to respond within 60 days from the date of request for payment. <BR/>   
                        <BR>
                        Once a decision between respective baggage claims/prorate offices has been made the list of agreed invoice billings to the responsible carrier(s) has to be uploaded into IATA SIS Clearing House to action the payments (outlined in IATA SIS RAM manual), attaching related tracing file reference number(s) and the flight date(s). In case there is no tracing file number any other reference that will be understand by Finance dealing with the invoices.
                        The agreed payment cannot be refused by SIS, only by the claim/prorate offices in part 1 of the process. The part 2 should be automatic.<BR/>
                        <BR>
                        We would also like to kindly remind you that having an up to date contact details on DFT page in WorldTracer and/or an equivalent page in NetTracer is necessary! Prorates should be handled by email as a matter of preference.<BR/>
                        <BR>
                        Thank you in advance for your cooperation.<BR/>
