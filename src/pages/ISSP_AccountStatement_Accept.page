						<p>
							The Web portal granting access to ICE (the "<strong>Portal</strong>") is operated by the International Air Transport Association (referred to herein as "    <strong>IATA</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>" or "<strong>our</strong>", as the case may be).
						</p>
						<p>
							Access to the products and services available on the Portal (the "<strong>ICE Tools</strong>") is restricted to users individually authorized by IATA
							(collectively, "<strong>Authorized Users</strong>") and to which IATA has provided a username and password (the "<strong>Access Codes</strong>").
						</p>
						<p>
							The Access Codes are granted on a strictly individual basis and cannot be transferred, sold, lent, leased or otherwise made accessible to any third party.
							As a holder of the Access Codes, you are responsible for using them in accordance with these Terms of Use and ensuring that they are never used by any
							person but you.
						</p>
						<p>
							By accessing the Portal, <u>you consent to be bound by these Terms of Use</u> and agree that they constitute a binding contract between you and IATA.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF OF ACCREDITED TRAVEL AGENCIES</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							When used herein, the term "Administrative Staff" means all persons who habitually perform primarily administrative tasks for the accredited travel agency
							(hereinafter "Travel Agency") or travel agent to whom they are subordinated when performing such tasks, whether that relationship of subordination results
							from an employment agreement, a services contract or some other type of agreement.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Travel Agency's executive officer or the travel agent (as the case may be) and the Administrative Staff subordinated thereto are solidarily responsible
							for the use of the Portal and the ICE Tools by such Administrative Staff.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you are an Administrative Staff member having access to the ICE Tools through the Access Codes of the Travel Agency or the travel agent for whom you
							work, please note that you may only use the ICE Tools for the benefit of such agency or agent, that you are personally bound by these Terms of Use and that
							you are prohibited from disclosing the Access Codes to anyone else.
						</p>
						<strong>
							AUTHORIZED USE
						</strong>
						<p>
							The Content (as defined below) is for the internal professional use only of Travel agencies and travel agents. No fee can be charged in relation to such

							You may, subject to these Terms of Use, print or by other means save pages of the Portal for the purposes of carrying on your travel agency's activities.
							The Content cannot be changed or altered in any way, merged with other information or published in any form whatsoever, in whole or in part or. Prohibited
							uses include "screen scraping", "database scraping" and any other activity, whether automated or not, whose intended purpose is to collect, store,
							reorganize or manipulate the Content. Any exemption from the foregoing is subject to the prior written consent of IATA.

						</p>
						<p>
							By accessing the Portal or the Content, you thereby grant IATA a perpetual, non-exclusive and unlimited licence in all intellectual property associated
							with the information pertaining to your BSP transactions or that you upload into a BSP (collectively, the "<strong>Data</strong>"). IATA may share the Data
							with the community of Authorized Users and with service providers located in Canada or abroad for the purpose of operating and improving the functioning of
							the ICE Tools and the Portal.

							ICE Tools, is presumed to be reliable, but we cannot guarantee that it is exhaustive, accurate or up-to-date. To the full extent authorized by applicable
							law, the Content and the Portal are provided to you "as is", without any warranty whatsoever. None of IATA or any of its members or partners can be held
							liable for any direct, incidental, secondary, indirect or punitive damages flowing from your access to or use of the Content or the Portal. Interruptions

							billings and billing calendar.

							<strong>RESPONSIBILITY OF BALANCES</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							In the event of any inaccuracy in any billing amounts, balances or other Data displayed in the ICE Tools, it is the responsibility of the Travel Agency or
							travel agent to report same to IATA as early as possible. IATA is not responsible for any such discrepancies nor for any consequences or damages resulting
							directly or indirectly from such inaccuracies.
						</p>
						<strong>
							NO WAIVER
						</strong>
						<p>
							No failure or delay on the part of IATA to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use shall be construed as the waiving of its

							document or information substantiating your use (or that of the Administrative Staff you are responsible for) of the Portal or the Content. You must
							respond to such requests without delay. IATA will then take whatever measures it, in its entire discretion, deems justified in light of your response, and
							may in particular temporarily or permanently interrupt your access (or that of the Administrative Staff you are responsible for) to the Portal and the
							Content.
						</p>
						<strong>
							DENIAL OF ACCESS
						</strong>
						<p>
							IATA retains the right, in its entire discretion, to cancel, limit or suspend your access to the Portal or to any portion of the Content without prior
							notice and without thereby incurring any liability, for any reason whatsoever, including any breach of these Terms of Use.
						</p>
						<strong>
							REVISIONS
						</strong>
						<p>
							IATA may at any time revise these Terms of Use by placing an updated version thereof on the Portal. All users of the Portal are bound by these Terms of Use
							and therefore must periodically consult this page in order to review any changes to their terms. If any change to these Terms of Use is substantial, we
							will highlight the change.
						</p>

						<p>
							These Terms of Use are governed by the laws of the province of Qu&#233;bec, Canada. The courts in Montr&#233;al, Qu&#233;bec shall have exclusive
							jurisdiction to hear and resolve any dispute in connection with these Terms of Use.
