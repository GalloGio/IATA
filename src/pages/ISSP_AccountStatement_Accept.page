              The Web portal granting access to ICE (the "<strong>Portal</strong>") is operated by the International Air Transport Association (referred to herein as "    <strong>IATA</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>" or "<strong>our</strong>", as the case may be).
              </p>
              <p>
                  Access to the products and services available on the Portal (the "<strong>ICE Tools</strong>") is restricted to users individually authorized by IATA
                  (collectively, "<strong>Authorized Users</strong>") and to which IATA has provided a username and password (the "<strong>Access Codes</strong>").
              </p>
              <p>
                  The Access Codes are granted on a strictly individual basis and cannot be transferred, sold, lent, leased or otherwise made accessible to any third party.
                  As a holder of the Access Codes, you are responsible for using them in accordance with these Terms of Use and ensuring that they are never used by any
                  person but you.
              </p>
              <p>
                  By accessing the Portal, <u>you consent to be bound by these Terms of Use</u> and agree that they constitute a binding contract between you and IATA.

              <p>
                  When used herein, the term "Administrative Staff" means all persons who habitually perform primarily administrative tasks for the accredited travel agency
                  (hereinafter "Travel Agency") or travel agent to whom they are subordinated when performing such tasks, whether that relationship of subordination results
                  from an employment agreement, a services contract or some other type of agreement.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The Travel Agency's executive officer or the travel agent (as the case may be) and the Administrative Staff subordinated thereto are solidarily responsible
                  for the use of the Portal and the ICE Tools by such Administrative Staff.
              </p>
              <p>
                  If you are an Administrative Staff member having access to the ICE Tools through the Access Codes of the Travel Agency or the travel agent for whom you
                  work, please note that you may only use the ICE Tools for the benefit of such agency or agent, that you are personally bound by these Terms of Use and that
                  you are prohibited from disclosing the Access Codes to anyone else.
              </p>

              <p>
                  In the event of any inaccuracy in any billing amounts, balances or other Data displayed in the ICE Tools, it is the responsibility of the Travel Agency or
