    <center class="bold underline">PREAMBLE</center>

    <p>
        <span class="bold">WHEREAS</span> IATA is an international association of airlines that promotes safe, regular and economical air transport and facilitates collaboration among air transport enterprises engaged directly or indirectly in international air transport services; 
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="bold">WHEREAS</span> IATA operates and manages one or more industry clearing houses as a service to the airline industry on a cost recovery basis; 
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="bold">WHEREAS</span> in 2007, to enhance the efficiency and reduce the cost of clearing house operations, IATA has developed an integrated billing and settlement solution to operate on a paperless basis and simplify existing processes (the “<span class="bold">SIS Project</span>”); 
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="bold">WHEREAS</span> the information technology solution resulting from the SIS Project to provide the air transport industry simplified, enhanced and optimized IATA settlement systems consists of: 
        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
            <li>(i) streamlining and integrating the industry settlement systems into a single coherent settlement process that can handle each and all types of billing (passenger, cargo, UATP, miscellaneous/non-transportation) including such as original billings, rejections, billing/credit memos and correspondence; </li>
            <li>(ii) adding electronic invoicing and support functionalities and services to reduce the cost of settlement, and </li>
            <li>(iii) making all of these enhancements available to all other air transport industry settlement processes involved in or forming part of the industry settlement systems (such as industry clearing houses) (all together “<span class="bold">SIS Solution</span>”); </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="bold">WHEREAS</span> IATA operates and provides the SIS Solution, the Service and the Additional Services (both terms Service and the Additional Services are defined below) from various locations worldwide, including through the use of subcontractors; 
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="bold">WHEREAS</span> The Parties now wish to set out the terms and conditions pursuant to which IATA has agreed to provide the Service and Additional Services to Participant, and Participant has agreed to accept the Service, and may elect to choose Additional Services, in exchange for certain fees, and where the Participant recognizes that IATA operates the Service and any Additional Services through sub-contractors worldwide not with the intent of generating profits and, to the extent practicable, essentially on a cost recovery basis, the whole as further set forth below; and 
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="bold">WHEREAS</span> the Parties understand and agree that IATA's willingness to perform the Services and the Additional Services on a cost recovery basis hereunder was and is a material factor in making the Parties agree to the terms and conditions herein, including in particular the provider-limited liability regime set forth in this Agreement. 
    </p>
    <p>This Preamble shall form an integral part of this Agreement.</p>
    <p class="bold">NOW THEREFORE THE PARTIES SIGNING THE VARIOUS COUNTERPARTS HEREOF AGREE AMONGST THEMSELVES AS FOLLOWS: </p>

    <p class="bold">1. SUBMISSION OF ELECTRONIC INVOICE DATA VIA ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE (EDI) FOR THE PURPOSE OF INTERLINE BILLING </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">1.1 The Parties agree to submit and receive (as applicable) electronic interline invoices in accordance with the procedures and standards set out in this Agreement. </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">1.2 The provisions of this Agreement are in addition to the procedures set out in the IATA Revenue Accounting Manual (“<span class="bold">RAM</span>”) and the Airline Clearing House (“<span class="bold">ACH</span>”) Manual of Procedure as amended from time to time. </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">1.3 This Agreement includes the Attachments A, B, C, D, E, F and G which may be amended in accordance with this Agreement, and published by IATA from time to time. </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">1.4 IATA shall enter into agreements with additional airlines, suppliers and other related parties for the provision of the Service and Additional Services (“<span class="bold">SIS Participants</span>”) only on the same standards, terms and conditions as set out herein. </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">1.5 Whenever used in this Agreement “<span class="bold">includes</span>” and “<span class="bold">including</span>” mean “including (or includes) without limitation”. </p>

    <p class="bold">2. PROVISION OF SERVICE </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">2.1 As of the Effective Date and during the Term of this Agreement, IATA shall be responsible for providing to the Participant, and Participant agrees to use the  Simplified Invoicing and Settlement (SIS) services described in the <span class="underline">Attachment D</span> (the “<span class="bold">Service</span>”) </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">2.2 Participant may also elect to use certain additional services in accordance with the <span class="underline">Attachment B</span> (“<span class="bold">Additional Services</span>”). </p>

    <p class="bold">3. PARTICIPATION IN THE SERVICE </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">3.1 Obligations and Responsibilities of the Participant </p>
    <p class="margin-6 indent-3">3.1.1 Participant shall pay IATA the fees and charges set out in Section 8 for the provision of the Service. </p>
    <p class="margin-6 indent-3">3.1.2 If Participant elects to use any Additional Services it shall pay IATA the fees and charges set out in Section 8 for the provision of such Additional Services as selected in Attachment B. </p>
    <p class="margin-6 indent-3">
        3.1.3 Participation in this Agreement is conditional upon Participant agreeing that IATA will be generating electronic invoices on the Participant's behalf, and on agreeing to accept electronic invoices from all other SIS Participants. Invoices are deemed to be received as soon as notification has been sent to the Participant. It is the Participant's responsibility to secure any permissions or authorizations that may be required in their country or countries of base regarding the use of electronic invoices, and to comply with laws that those countries may apply to the creation of invoices, determination of applicable taxes, management of access controls, record keeping and legal archiving. The correctness of any data submitted to the Service and/or Additional Services remains the responsibility of the Participant at all times. Where electronic signatures have been requested, the Participant authorizes IATA to apply or validate the electronic signature through the electronic signature service providers listed in Attachment D and as amended from time to time.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6 indent-3">3.1.4 Participation is conditional upon preliminary testing and successful completion of the certification process for the file types that Participant intends to submit. </p>
    <p class="margin-6 indent-3">3.1.5 Settlement of invoices entered into the Service will be made directly by the debtor to the creditor using such channels as may have been agreed between them. Where settlement is to be effected through an industry clearing house, each SIS Participant must have access to and act in compliance with the rules of a clearing house. </p>
    <p class="margin-6 indent-3">3.1.6 The Participant acknowledges that settlement of electronically submitted invoices via the Service could generate an automatic default notice if payment is made by any Participant not based on the gross amount of the invoice, but on the gross amount net of deduction or withholdings based on taxes or other governmental charges. </p>
    <p class="margin-6 indent-3">
        3.1.7 In supplying Data (as further defined) and any other data to be included in the Service and Simplified Invoicing and Settlement (SIS) system (“<span class="bold">System</span>”), the Participant shall comply with the procedures and standards provided for in this Agreement. All invoice data supplied must be transmitted in compliance with the published IS-XML or IS-IDEC standards as valid at the time, or be entered by the Participant via the user interface provided. The Participant shall maintain in the System a full and up to date list of the names of persons authorized by it to supply, modify, or withdraw data on its behalf or to issue instructions concerning the applicability or distribution thereof. IATA will make all reasonable efforts to conform to the Participant's instructions in a timely manner.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6 indent-3">3.1.8 Where a Participant has issued an electronic invoice that it believes to be in error, it must promptly notify IATA and the designated recipient, and take the necessary steps to correct the situation in accordance with the procedures described in the RAM, the ACH Manual of Procedure and/or other clearing house procedures, as applicable. </p>
    <p class="margin-6 indent-3">3.1.9 The Participant holds the entire responsibility for the accuracy and the completeness of the tax and VAT-related information it provides to IATA and third parties in connection with the Service. When national legislations provide for specific validation procedure for the tax or VAT identification number of the customer, the obligation to perform such validation remains with the Participant. </p>
    <p class="margin-6 indent-3">
        3.1.10 It is the sole responsibility of the Participant to ensure the Data or any other information transmitted via the Service and/or Additional Services is in compliance with applicable laws, including applicable privacy laws. To the extent applicable, any payment card data supplied under the Service by the Participant or any third party acting on its behalf shall be masked in accordance with Payment Card Industry Digital Security Standard (PCI-DSS) specifications using the format 123456XXXXXX7890.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">3.2 Personal Data </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        IATA may receive Personal Data (as defined below) under this Agreement from the Participant or its employees. IATA shall process such Personal Data solely as needed for the performance of the Service and/or Additional Services. Furthermore, in accordance with EU Directive 95/46/EC, if requested by Participant, the Parties shall sign the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, as attached hereto as Attachment G, pursuant to which IATA may transfer the Personal Data to its subcontractors on condition that such subcontractors have entered into the same obligations. “<span class="bold">Personal Data</span>” means any data, which permits the identification of an individual. IATA hereby notifies Participant of such processing and Participant hereby grants consent required for the processing of Personal Data. Participant agrees that IATA shall not be in breach of this Agreement if IATA refuses to perform any transaction offered as part of the Service and/or Additional Services described in this Agreement to Participant when Participant's employee, agent and/or representative refuses to consent to the processing of its necessary Personal Data for the performance of such transaction(s). 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">3.3 For the purpose of this Agreement “<span class="bold">Data</span>” includes all information (including Personal Data) to be provided to or otherwise made available to or processed by the System, the SIS Solution, the Service, the Additional Services or IATA, by the Participant or any third party acting on its behalf for purposes of or in relation to this Agreement, the SIS Solution, the Service or the Additional Services. </p>

    <p class="bold">4. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION OF STANDARD AGREEMENT </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">4.1 The general administration of this Agreement shall be undertaken by IATA. </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">4.2 The cost of administering the Service is met by charging a combination of a participation fee plus transaction fees in accordance with the Pricing Schedule in Attachment A and as amended from time to time in order to recover Service operating costs. </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">4.3 All communications from the Participant concerning this Agreement shall be addressed to IATA.

    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">4.5 Any failure identified in the provision of the Service will be directed in the first instance to the designated help desk as provided in Attachment E, which shall log the failure and identify the action required. </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">
        4.6 Each Participant shall file a signed copy of this Agreement with IATA, together with a schedule of dates outlining when the Participant will implement Simplified Invoicing and Settlement (SIS) processes for each clearing house transaction category. IATA Revenue Accounting will publish, in the form of Attachment F to this Agreement, the names of the SIS Participants that are participating in the “<span class="bold">Service</span>” and in which clearing house transaction categories they participate. In the case of SIS Participants that are members of the ACH, IATA will also notify the ACH Secretary-Treasurer, who will publish to ACH members.
    </p>

    <p class="bold">5. GOVERNANCE </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">5.1 The Service is governed by the groups referred to below and described in Attachment C. </p>

    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">5.5 In IATA or SIS Steering Group's opinion, when elections or other measures require action by Participants outside the schedule of SIS General Meetings, Participant agrees that a mail vote may be taken as an alternative. </p>

    <p class="bold">6. MODIFICATIONS </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">
        6.1 Amendments to System functionality may be submitted as a proposal to the SIS General Meeting duly convened in accordance with paragraph 5.2 and shall be referred initially to the SIS Steering Group for review. If accepted by the SIS Steering Group they will be referred to SIS Operations (as defined in Attachment C) for analysis and costing. SIS Operations will then develop the specifications. The final agreed proposal shall be submitted to the SIS Steering Group for approval. Changes to system functionality may be proposed by the Participants at any time before the deadline of the SIS General Meeting. Major changes to system functionality must be approved by IATA to ensure operational efficiency.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">6.2 Amendments to System functionality as a result of industry mandated changes shall be initiated by the SIS Steering Group and referred to SIS Operations for review and costing. SIS Operations will then develop the specifications. The final agreed proposal shall be submitted to the SIS Steering Group for approval. </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">6.3 Amendments to the then current Agreement which are accepted by IATA and agreed by seventy five percent (75%) of those present at the SIS General Meeting, duly convened in accordance with paragraphs 5.2 and 5.3 shall become effective and shall be applied by all SIS Participants, as from a date which shall be determined by the SIS Participants present and entitled to vote at the SIS General Meeting. </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">6.4 To be eligible to vote for changes to this Agreement with Attachments, the Participant must be transmitting and receiving invoices through the Service. </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">6.5 Where changes to the RAM, ACH Manual of Procedure, or other industry rulings require changes to this Agreement, the SIS Steering Group is empowered to agree to the appropriate amendments to this Agreement. The SIS Steering Group shall notify the Participants of all amendments, giving their date of effectiveness. </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">6.6 In addition, when IATA's review of an operational and/or individual Participant problem suggests that an editorial change would improve understanding, IATA may make editorial amendments provided they do not change the intent of the Agreement and/or procedures. Editorial amendments that do not change the intent of the Agreement and/or procedures will be notified via the RAM. IATA will notify the ACH Secretary-Treasurer. </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">6.7 All changes and amendments made in accordance with paragraphs 6.5 and 6.6 above will be submitted to the next SIS General Meeting for final ratification. </p>

    <p class="bold">7. SERVICE LEVEL </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">7.1 General </p>
    <p class="margin-3">The level of performance of the Service shall be at least consistent with the service levels described in Attachment E (“<span class="bold">Service Levels</span>”). </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">7.2 Failure to Perform </p>
    <p class="margin-3">In the event IATA fails to meet any Service Level requirement, IATA shall, or shall cause its sub-contractor to, (i) investigate the causes of such failure; (ii) take the necessary measures to correct such failure within the time frames set forth in Attachment E and start implementing the corrective measures, and (iv) take appropriate preventive measures so that such failure does not reoccur. </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">7.3 Service Level Credits </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Any Service Level credit available to IATA will be applicable for the benefit of all SIS Participants and/or the industry. Such Service Level credits shall not be Participant's exclusive remedy for any failure to meet the Service Levels; however, any amount of Service Level credits effectively received by Participant will be deducted from monetary damages recovered by Participant from IATA as a result of an event also giving rise to a Service Level credit. The balance of any such monetary damages will be recoverable under Section 13.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">7.4 Measurement and Monitoring Tools </p>
    <p class="margin-6 indent-3">7.4.1 IATA will monitor that the provision of the Service and Additional Services is in accordance with the Service Levels described in Attachment E. IATA shall use the necessary measurement and monitoring tools and procedures required to measure the performance of the Service and Additional Services against the applicable Service Levels. </p>
    <p class="margin-6 indent-3">
        7.4.2 Each Service Level shall be measured on a monthly basis and reported to the SIS Steering Group quarterly, unless stated otherwise in Attachment E. IATA shall, upon request of the Steering Group, provide reports at a sufficient level of detail, to verify the Service performance and compliance with the Service Levels. This data shall be provided to the Steering Group, and shall be considered Confidential Information. For the avoidance of doubt, any such report shall not contain any Data (as defined below).
    </p>

    <p class="bold">8. FEES AND CHARGES </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">8.1 Fees and charges for the Service and the Additional Services as described in Attachment A will be paid by the Participant for the Service and/or the Additional Services. </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">
        8.2 The fees and charges do not include, communication charges relating to the Participant's transmission of input or receipt of output files, customization of software, systems integration, any implementation in the Participant's premises, audit certification or other legal process requested by the Participant, set-up fees, or enhancements. Fees for any such services that might be required for Participant and have been received shall be agreed separately and in advance between the Participant and IATA or its service providers.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">
        8.3 Fees and charges are payable to IATA within thirty (30) days of billing. Fees and charges against members of the IATA Clearing House (“<span class="bold">ICH</span>”) or the Airlines Clearing House (“<span class="bold">ACH</span>”) shall be collected through the appropriate clearing house unless otherwise agreed. IATA may suspend provision of the Service upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in the event of failure by the Participant to settle any invoice or charge for the Service in a timely manner.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">8.4 Any surplus revenues for the provision of the Service and the Additional Services will be reviewed by the SIS Steering Group, who shall have the right to propose an apportionment of the surplus to cover further development and/or a reduction in operating charges. IATA will use its best efforts to provide the Service at the lowest cost practicable. </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">8.5 The Parties recognize that the charges for the Service and/or Additional Services shall be calculated using a cost recovery model which is to balance over a one (1) year period unless an alternative period is agreed by the SIS Steering Group. </p>

    <p class="bold">9. TAXES </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">
        9.1 Payment for fees and charges related to the use of the Service and/or Additional Services must be made by the Participant without any set-off or counter claim and free of deduction or withholding of any taxes or governmental charges (except as required by law). If any deduction or withholding is required by law, the Participant must pay the required amount to the relevant governmental authority, and pay to IATA as the case may be, in addition to the payment to which it is otherwise entitled under this Agreement, such additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by IATA, free and clear of all taxes, equals the full amount IATA would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">
        9.2 Should any taxes, levies, charges or duties (including any goods and services or other value added tax) be imposed, levied or become payable on the supply of the Service and/or Additional Services made to Participant pursuant to this Agreement, the Participant shall pay any and all such taxes, levies, charges and duties, in addition to any other payments due under this Agreement. In the event IATA pays any such tax or assessment, Participant will immediately reimburse IATA upon demand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Party shall be responsible for the other Party's taxes which are based on net or gross income or capital.
    </p>

    <p class="bold">10. WARRANTIES AND LIABILITIES </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5">10.1 The Participant hereby represents and warrants that: </p>
    <p class="margin-6 indent-3">10.1.1 it has obtained all operating licenses or government authorizations required for engaging in business; </p>
    <p class="margin-6 indent-3">
        10.1.2 it owns or has obtained all required rights in respect of any and all Data, including in relation to its collection, processing, provision, use, disclosure, validation and/or disposal as part of or in relation to this Agreement, the System, the SIS Solution, the Service or the Additional Services and all required rights otherwise necessary for the purposes of this Agreement, the whole in compliance with all applicable laws, including data privacy and data security laws;
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6 indent-3">
        10.1.3 it will use, handle, protect, dispose of and otherwise deal with any and all data of any and all other SIS Participants made available to it via the System and/or SIS Solution and/or otherwise by or through IATA solely for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement and in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all applicable laws, and with a degree of care at least as high as the one that is applied to its own Data hereunder; and
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6 indent-3">
        10.1.4 it shall be responsible for ensuring that the Data or any attachment supplied by itself, its respective employees, agents, and contractors does not contain or introduce any Destructive Elements. If Participant becomes aware that a Destructive Element has been so introduced, Participant will eliminate the effects of the Destructive Element and, if the Destructive Element causes a loss (e.g., of operational efficiency or data), assist IATA to mitigate and restore such losses provided that it shall not prevent IATA from exercising any recourse it may have against Participant under this Agreement or at law. “<span class="bold">Destructive Elements</span>” means any software, data or tool (e.g., “viruses”, “worms” or “trojan” programs) that (i) are intentionally designed to disrupt, disable, harm or otherwise impede in any manner, including aesthetical disruptions or distortions, the operation of the Service or related systems of IATA, including, for example, based on the elapsing of a period of time, exceeding an authorized number of copies, advancement to a particular date or other numeral (e.g., “time bombs”, “time locks” or “drop dead” devices), (ii) would permit Participant or third parties to access the Service or related systems, to cause such disablement or impairment, or otherwise to circumvent the security features of the Service or related systems, or (iii) contain any other harmful, malicious or hidden procedures, routines or mechanisms which would cause the Service or related systems to cease functioning, or to damage or corrupt software, data or communications, or otherwise interfere with operations.

    <p class="margin-3">IATA may monitor individual use of and access to the Service to ensure compliance with the rules, policies, deadlines and instructions applicable thereto. The Participant using the Service expressly consents to such monitoring. If such monitoring reveals possible criminal activity or unauthorized use, IATA may immediately suspend the individual user's access and/or the Participant's access to the Service and/or provide the evidence of such monitoring to law enforcement officials. IATA shall notify the Participant of any such action to be taken unless instructed otherwise by the law enforcement officials. IATA reserves the right to maintain and, for any legitimate reason, review logs containing any inquiry details and other activities performed by the Participant in connection with the Participant's use of the Service.

        18.4 During the Term of this Agreement, in the event of a material breach, the non-breaching Party may terminate the Agreement, in whole or in part, by giving thirty (30) days written notice to the breaching Party specifically identifying the breach, unless the breach is cured by the breaching Party within the thirty (30) day period. Material breach by Participant includes when Participant is in default of payment of fees and charges for Service and/or Additional Services as per Section 8.3 for more than sixty (60) days (unless such fees and charges are subject to a legitimate dispute between the Parties acting in good faith). For sake of clarity, IATA's acceptance of the indemnification under Section 11.2 shall constitute a cure for the purposes of this Section 18.4. Either Party may also terminate this Agreement on written notice to the other Party (i) if an Event of Insolvency occurs with respect to the other Party, or (ii) as otherwise expressly allowed hereunder. A Party affected by an Event of Insolvency in respect of itself must immediately notify the other Party in writing of the occurrence of such Event of Insolvency. “<span class="bold">Event of Insolvency</span>” means any instance where a Party makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or petitions for reorganization or arrangement, or where a petition in bankruptcy is filed against a Party, or where a receiver or trustee is appointed for all or any part of the property and asset of a Party, or otherwise commit any act of insolvency, under any Laws of New York and of any other jurisdiction in the world relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, stay of creditor remedies, moratorium, compromise, arrangement, extension, adjustment or reorganization of debts or other liabilities, liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, excluding any solvent reorganization or scheme arrangement.

Delays by suppliers or vendors are not considered Force Majeure Events, unless those suppliers or vendors themselves are prevented from delivering the service or otherwise performing their obligations due to a Force Majeure Event. Notwithstanding the above, IATA shall make all reasonable efforts to restore the Service and/or Additional Services as promptly as possible.

        ATTACHMENT A — PRICING SCHEDULE
    </h2>

    <p>
        The Service will be run on an operational cost-recovery basis, and the fees are subject to adjustment to ensure that operational costs are recovered. The prices below are effective 01 January 2019 and reflect the current best estimate of the charges necessary to operate the SIS Solution on a cost-recovery basis. As more information is made available to IATA about the estimated and actual use of the Service, prices will be adjusted in order to maintain neutral revenue. The annual accounts of the SIS operations covering the actual and planned cost and revenues will be shared with the SG in a timely manner.

    <p>
        1: The charge for auto-billing request does not include the invoice and prime coupons that are then submitted on the carrier's behalf; those are charged additionally at the described rates.
    </p>
    <p>
        * All transactions entered via the IS-WEB interface and not via IS-IDEC or IS-XML (including Correspondence, which are only entered via IS-WEB) will be charged an additional 25%. This surcharge will not apply to supporting documents uploaded via the IS-WEB interface. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Additional Notes on the Service Transaction Fees: 
        <ul>
            <li>For the purposes of determining the proper category, fees will only take into account the Service transactional charges and not any annual fee paid. </li>
            <li>Digital signature charges may be payable by both the billing and billed Participant based on their selections. </li>
            <li>Supporting Document charges are based on the stored document size (documents are stored unzipped), not the transmitted document size (documents are transmitted zipped). </li>
            <li>Where twelve months of data is not available, the Base charging band will be applied, and re-assessed quarterly on an annualised volume basis until twelve months history is available. </li>
            <li>Effective January 2018 - Rejection Memo, Billing Memo and Credit Memo charges are based on the count of memo coupon/AWB breakdowns instead of RM/BM/CM memo counts. </li>
            <li>A&amp;A fees are not included in the above figures and will be charged separately by A&amp;A. The “Value Determination” and “Auto-billing” features of Integrated Settlement require the storage option from A&amp;A. </li>

        3. OPTIONAL SERVICES 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        3.1 Digital Signature application 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS offers a digital signature (DS) application service in a number of countries with the help of a trusted digital signature service provider. Based on the instructions provided by the billing entity, SIS creates an invoice subset file from the SIS-format invoice data with the necessary legal and invoice information fields. This digitally signed file is made available by SIS as one of the outputs to the billing entity at the end of the billing period, based on the configuration of the Member Profile. It can also be downloaded online over the IS-WEB.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS allows billed entities to configure the application of Digital Signature on Payable Invoices in the Member Profile. Based on the location details specified on the payable invoice, SIS triggers the process to apply digital signature in the countries covered by the service. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        3.2 Digital Signature verification 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS provides an option whereby the billed entity can request verification of the digital signature applied on Payable Invoices, via the Member Profile. A verification log file is created by this process which contains the status of the applied digital signature in the countries covered by the service. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        3.3 Legal Archiving (or E-Archiving) service 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Some jurisdictions may require legal storage for the digitally signed invoices for varying amounts of time. During this period, the invoices and any applicable digital signature need to be accessible for any audits. To address this issue, SIS will provide an optional Legal Archiving service to store the digitally signed invoices and other related information on behalf of the Participant in an external Legal archive for a longer period as required by the local regulations. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        3.4 Billing Value Determination 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        As part of this service, SIS accepts Usage Files (modified Record 50 file format as defined in the IS Participation guide) from billing entities requesting prorate values for coupons utilized by them. SIS validates the file format and forwards the Usage File to ATPCO for further processing. The processed information is provided by ATPCO back to SIS. IS forwards the output files provided by ATPCO to the billing entities. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        3.5 Billing Value Confirmation 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS generates a Billing Value Confirmation file for passenger prime billing coupons where both the billing entity and billed entity are subscribers to this service. This file is forwarded to ATPCO for further processing. ATPCO validates the billing values with the prorate values stored within its database. Any exchange rate conversions of the prorate values as per the billing month will be done by ATPCO before comparing the values. The results of the comparison are updated by ATPCO and provided to SIS. SIS updates the comparison results within its Billing Record Database. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        3.6 Auto-billing 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        As part of this service, SIS will store the prorate records received through the Value Determination process and generate invoices on behalf of the Billing Entity. On a daily basis SIS will generate a Revenue Recognition File (File Format defined in the IS Participation Guide) containing the billing records of coupons included in the Auto-Billing Invoices. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The Auto-Billed invoices are automatically closed and finalized by SIS and processed further like any other IS-IDEC/IS-XML invoices. At the end of the billing period, SIS generates an Invoice Posting File which includes details of all Auto-Billed invoices

        ATTACHMENT D — SIMPLIFIED INVOICING AND SETTLEMENT (SIS) SERVICE DESCRIPTION
    </h2>

    <p class="bold">
        Simplified Invoicing and Settlement (SIS) Service Description
    </p>

    <p class="bold">
        1. BACKGROUND 
    </p>
    <p>
        The SIS project aims to simplify interline billing, and to remove paper from the entire process, delivering tangible financial benefits to the industry. The vision is that a billing entity will submit a single electronic billing file that will be converted into an invoice and a settlement file, sent to the billed entity, and cleared through the relevant clearing house. As part of this project, an “Simplified Invoicing and Settlement” (SIS) System has been developed based on the principles of completely paperless billing, invoicing, and settlement. The SIS solution encompasses Passenger, Cargo, Miscellaneous and UATP interline billings with settlements through ICH, ACH or on a bilateral basis. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In this document the terms Simplified Invoicing and Settlement (SIS) and Integrated Settlement (IS) may be used interchangeably and the term IS Member(s) has the same meaning as Participant and/or SIS Participants, as the case may be. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        1.1 Overview of Simplified Invoicing and Settlement (SIS) 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS is an Invoicing Platform which is connected to various external systems such as ICH, ACH, ATPCO, a trusted Digital Signature service provider, etc., thus providing a single point of communication for Interline billing, invoicing and settlement. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        A high level overview of SIS is shown in Figure 1 below: 
    </p>

    <figure>
        <apex:image width="680" value="{!URLFOR($Resource.ISSP_MembershipApplicationFormPDF,'img/ISPA_figure1.jpg')}"/>
        <figcaption>Figure: Overview of Simplified Invoicing and Settlement (SIS)</figcaption>
    </figure> 

    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application can be grouped into the following logical modules: 
        <ul>
            <li>SIS Member and User Management </li>
            <li>Receivables Data Processing </li>
            <li>Payables Data Processing </li>
            <li>Correspondence Management </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        The services provided by each module are described in the subsequent chapters.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        1.2 Supporting Documentation 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The following documents provide additional information to the services described in this document:
        <ul>
            <li>SIS Participation Guide: This document provides the details of the impact of SIS on the IT systems and processes of the SIS Members. </li>
            <li>Sign up and Certification Guide: This document provides detail explanation on the Sign up process and steps to be followed to get certified for SIS. </li>
            <li>IATA Revenue Accounting Manual (RAM): The RAM contains all the rules and procedures associated with interline billing, with which the IS application will be compliant, and of which the SIS Participation Agreement and this Attachment are a part. </li>
            <li>ACH Manual of Procedure: For members of the ACH, the Manual of Procedure contains all the rules and procedures associated with billings using the ACH for settlement. </li>
            <li>SIS User Guide: This manual documents all the functional processes of SIS that are available to the individual user. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        1.3 Standard Services and Optional Services 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Standard Services such as submission of invoices, flight coupon data, air waybill data, rejections etc. are available to any Member as soon as participation formalities have been completed. Optional Services require specific notification or request to SIS Operations (SIS-Ops), whether before or after use of the service has commenced. Use of optional services will incur additional charges (such as Digital Signatures) and may also require secondary agreements to be signed (such as for A&amp;A services). Because a service is shown as ‘Optional’ in SIS does not mean that it is optional in the Members operating jurisdictions. 
    </p>

    <p class="bold">
        2. MEMBER AND USER MANAGEMENT 
    </p>
    <p>
        The SIS application allows SIS Members to configure their company and staff responsibility details using the Member Profile module over IS-WEB. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        2.1 Member Creation 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The initial set-up of SIS Member is done by SIS-Ops using existing information within IATA, ICH, ACH etc. as well as using information sourced from individual members during the sign-up process. This is done for all airline entities defined in the Airline Coding Database as well as non-airline entities who are members of ICH and/or ACH. Once the participation formalities are completed, the Membership status is activated by SIS-Ops and a Super user account is created and provided to the
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS Member. Login credentials to access IS-WEB as well as the FTP server (if required) are also provided by SIS-Ops so that the SIS Member can communicate with the SIS Platform. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Note:
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS Member will have to go through the Sandbox Testing and Certification process to be able to send invoice files to SIS. This process is described in detail in the SIS Sign Up and Certification Guide.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        2.2 Member Profile Set-up 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Using the login credentials provided by SIS-Ops, the SIS Member can login to IS-WEB and review the set-up details on the Member Profile Screen. SIS allows the SIS Member to update the details on the Member Profile. Certain fields on the Member Profile will only allow changes to be made which will be applicable for a future billing period or date. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6 bold">
        Member Details
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6">
        SIS application will allow the SIS Member to upload and store its official logo on to its platform. This logo will be used by SIS to display the image on the PDF invoices generated on behalf of the SIS Member. The Member's Accounting Code, Prefix, Legal Name, Status in SIS, IATA, the ICH, or the ACH, and the details of the Member's bank accounts for bilateral settlements cannot be changed by the SIS Member and must be referred to SIS-Ops. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6 bold">
        Location Details
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6">
        Every SIS Member needs to have at least one location detail setup in the Member Profile. This will be the default location of the SIS Member and is referred to as the “MAIN” location. The SIS Member will be allowed to update the details of the MAIN location as well as create any additional location details that may be required for legal or business reasons. This information is used at the time of PDF Invoice generation as well as when generating the Payable output invoices, in case the invoice reference data is not provided in the incoming receivables invoice. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6 bold">
        Bank Details for Bilateral Settlement
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6">
        Bank details can be set-up against each location created in the Member Profile to be used in case of bilateral settlement invoices. This set-up can only be done by SIS-Ops based on signed physical requests from the SIS Members. This information is included by SIS in the Payable Invoice in case of Bilateral Settlement. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6 bold">
        Contacts
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6">
        SIS allows set-up of two types of contacts in the Member Profile: 
        <ul class="margin-9">
            <li>Informational Contacts: These contacts are set up for purely informational purposes, For example Passenger RA Manager, etc. The contact details include information such as the name, designation, address, contact numbers, email id etc. of that person. The SIS application allows IS Members to retrieve the informational contacts of other SIS Members. As part of the initial data set-up, SIS-Ops will configure some of the informational contacts of the SIS Member based on the data available within IATA (RAM, ACH Manual of Procedure, ICH database, etc.). </li>
            <li>Processing Contacts: These contacts, if set up by the SIS Member, will receive email alerts on specific events related to invoice processing e.g. Passenger File Receipt Alert Contact, Cargo Correspondence Alert Contact etc. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6 bold">
        E-invoicing and Billing Category Specific Details
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6">
        SIS allows the SIS Member to set-up Billing Category and e-invoicing specific parameters on the Member Profile which control the behavior of the SIS application at the time of processing. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6 bold">
        Clearing House Specific Details
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6">
        SIS allows view access to the Clearing House set-up details to the SIS Members. This information can only be updated by the respective clearing house operations team members. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6 bold">
        Technical Details
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6">
        The SIS application allows the SIS Members to store the login credentials of the ftp servers/iiNET where the output files needs to be provided. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        2.3 User Set-up 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS platform allows different type of users to be configured in the system. These include:
        <ol class="margin-6">
            <li>SIS Member Users </li>
            <li>SIS-Ops Users </li>
            <li>ICH Ops Users </li>
            <li>ACH Ops Users </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Depending on the type of the user, the IS-WEB Menu structure and the Screens changes accordingly. The User profile details stored in SIS includes the name, location details, email id, contact number etc of the person. The email id of the user acts as the login id for IS-WEB. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        In case of SIS Member Users, SIS-Ops creates a Member Super User account once the participation formalities are completed. This Member Super User can create other Users for the SIS Member. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        2.4 Assign Permissions 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS Platform will assign the maximum permission allowed for a SIS Member User to the SIS Member Super User Account. The SIS Member Super User, at the time of creating other users, can assign permissions to the users. These include permissions for viewing/editing information on a particular screen, permission to perform some special operations on specific screens, permission to create other users etc. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application will have default templates to assign permissions, which can be used by SIS Member users to assign permissions. Member Users will also have the ability to create their own permission templates and apply them to their users. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application also provides a facility to copy the user permission profile from one user and replicate them on other users. 
    </p>

    <p class="bold">
        3. DATA TRANSMISSION 
    </p>
All files to and from SIS will be processed initially by iiNet on behalf of SIS. Files will be received by iiNet from all Members, and will be transmitted by iiNet to the SIS application. Once the file is received correctly by iiNet, iiNet will complete delivery to the SIS application. Any files to be transmitted to a Member will be sent by the SIS application to iiNet, and will be transmitted from iiNet to the Member. 
Files from the Member must be pushed to iiNet, and files from iiNet to the Member may be pushed by iiNet or pulled by the Member at the Member's choice. 
There are no fees for this service provided by iiNet for files transmitted from and to SIS, but usage will require separate acceptance of the iiNet Terms Of Use. Any added-value services provided by iiNet beyond transmission between the SIS Member and SIS are subject to iiNet's normal terms and conditions, and fees may be applicable. 
    <p class="bold">
        4. RECEIVABLES PROCESSING 
    </p>
The SIS application will process the incoming invoices and supporting documents provided by the billing entities for all four Interline Billing Categories (Passenger, Cargo, Miscellaneous and UATP). 
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        4.1 Invoice Data Processing 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Input Possibilities
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application allows the billing entities to provide invoice information in multiple electronic formats. In the case of Passenger and Cargo billings, the invoice information can be provided in a flat file based structure (IS-IDEC) or in an XML file format (IS-XML). Miscellaneous and UATP invoices can be submitted only in the IS-XML format. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Along with the electronic mode of invoice submission, SIS will also provide a facility to manually capture and review invoice information online over the internet, named IS-WEB. The table below details the support provided by SIS for different type of transactions within each Billing Category.

        Data Validation
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        Invoice data provided by the billing entities will be validated by SIS. This process will ensure that the invoice data is of good quality and the billed entities can process the same without any issue within their internal systems. This process will take place upon receipt of each SIS billing file. 
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        The different types of validation checks performed by the IS application are as follows: 
    </p>
    <ul class="margin-6">
        <li>File Construction checks: SIS will validate if the invoice files are created as per the defined file specifications, naming convention, duplicate files, compression logic, etc </li>
        <li>Field Format checks: SIS will check if data values have been provided for mandatory data elements, conditionally mandatory data elements if the condition is met, etc. It will also ensure that the data is provided as per the field format (e.g. numeric, alphabetic, date, etc) and as per the field length specifications (e.g. numeric field with a maximum of 5 digits) </li>
        <li>Reference Master checks: Invoice data fields having standard reference data values are valid (e.g. From City field if populated should have a valid IATA city/airport code, etc) </li>
        <li>Interline Billing Rules checks: Some of the Interline billing rules defined in the RAM or ACH Manual of Procedure, such as possible duplicate billing check, outside time limit billings, minimum billing amount check for different type of transaction, etc. </li>
        <li>Settlement Information checks: SIS will validate the correctness of the Settlement details provided on the invoice if it needs to be cleared through a clearing house (e.g. Currency of Clearance information, Clearing House information, etc). </li>
        <li>Billing Audit Trail checks: SIS will check if the various stages of billing are linked together and there are no out of turn billings (e.g. validation of ‘Previous Invoice number’, ‘Previous Billing Month’, ‘Previous Rejection number’, ‘Rejection Stage number’ in case of Rejections etc) </li>
        <li>Computation checks: SIS will validate if billing amounts specified at various levels within the invoice add up together (e.g. the invoice total adds up to the sum of all Line Item totals, similarly Line Item total adds up to the sum of all Line Item details totals etc). The total of the line items must not vary from the invoice value by more than a small tolerance. </li>
        <li>Legal Requirement checks: SIS will validate if certain legal requirements are satisfied by the Billing Entity in the invoice data (e.g. invoice Number is unique for a Billing Member within a calendar year, VAT breakdown information is provided in the case that VAT amounts are billed in the invoice, etc) </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Wherever possible, SIS will validate the entire file and identify all possible errors in the file. A validation report is generated at the end of this process and is provided to Billing Entity irrespective of the status of the validation. In case of errors, the Billing Entity can configure its Member Profile to receive an email alerting its contact about the details of the Validation error. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Invoice data captured using IS-WEB is validated at the time of data entry. SIS will alert the user in case invalid data in entered at the time of saving the information. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS Platform does not validate the following: 
    </p>
    <ul class="margin-6">
        <li>Whether the entity can legally bill the invoice through SIS </li>
        <li>Whether the billed amounts are correct </li>
        <li>Whether all required taxes are applied correctly </li>
        <li>Whether all required legal information of all countries in the world is provided </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Error Handling
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        In case of validation error, SIS provides a facility to delete the erroneous invoices or the entire file through IS-WEB. For certain errors, SIS also provides an option of carrying out online correction on the IS-WEB. These correctable errors are errors related to reference data values such as invalid city/airport code, invalid tax code etc. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Invoices in an error status are not considered for further processing by SIS.

        4.2 Supporting Document Management 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Input Possibilities
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS provides the facility for billing entities to supply supporting documents in electronic format in both batch and as online modes. At the time of invoice capture, billing entities can manually upload the supporting documents. SIS will store the uploaded supporting documents and link them to the invoice, or to the transaction within the invoice. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS supports 3 indexing options for submitting supporting documents in a batch mode. These are: 
        <ul class="margin-6">
            <li>Using folder name based indexing </li>
            <li>Using a CSV file based indexing </li>
            <li>Using an XML file based indexing </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        The formats are explained in the SIS Participation Guide.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Billing entities can use any of the options to submit the batch supporting documents to SIS. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        On successful receipt of a batch supporting file, SIS generates a confirmation email and sends it to the billing entity.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Data Validation
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS carries out certain sanity checks on the batch supporting document file before it is considered for processing. The different type of checks includes the following: 
        <ul class="margin-6">
            <li>File Construction checks: SIS will validate if the batch supporting documents files are created as per the defined file specifications, naming convention, duplicate files, compression logic, etc </li>
            <li>Index Information checks: SIS will validate the index information supplied with the batch supporting documents files and confirm if it is as per the defined specification. </li>
            <li>File Extension checks: SIS will validate the file extensions of the individual supporting documents and check if it matches with one of the supported neutral file formats. In case it is not a neutral file format, SIS will validate if any exceptions for supporting document file types have been defined in the Member Profile of the billed entity for acceptance. If it is not an exception, SIS will delete the supporting document file from the system. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Wherever possible, SIS will validate the entire file and identify all possible issues in the batch supporting document file. A validation report is generated at the end of this process and is provided to the billing entity. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Automated Linking of Supporting Documents
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application will carry out auto-linking of supporting documents provided in a batch mode to the corresponding billing record. This linking will be based on the Index information supplied in the batch supporting document file. Invoices which are successfully validated will be considered for automated linking. SIS will take care of any timing issues in case of automated linking if the supporting document file is provided prior to the invoice being successfully validated. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        For cases where the SIS application is not able to automatically link the supporting documents, SIS provides a facility by which the billing entity can update the linking information on IS-WEB and manually trigger the linking process. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        4.3 Value Determination, Auto-Billing and Billing Value Confirmation 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Value Determination
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        This is an optional service provided by SIS in conjunction with A&amp;A which can be utilized by Passenger billing entities that store prorated coupon values within ARC COMPASS®. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        As part of this service, SIS accepts Usage Files (modified Record 50 file format as defined in the SIS Participation guide) from billing entities requesting prorate values for coupons utilized by them. SIS validates the file format and forwards the Usage File to ATPCO for further processing. The processed information is provided by ATPCO back to SIS. SIS forwards the output files provided by ATPCO to the billing entities. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Internally SIS keeps track of which transactions were provided by the billing entities for processing and which transactions were processed and returned by ATPCO. On a daily basis SIS creates a report highlighting transactions where a response is not provided by ATPCO as per the defined timelines, and provides it to the billing entities. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Auto-Billing
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Auto-Billing is an optional service provided by SIS in conjunction with A&amp;A and is an extension of the Value Determination process. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        As part of this service, SIS will store the prorate records received through the Value Determination process and generate invoices on behalf of the Billing Entity. On a daily basis SIS will generate a Revenue Recognition File (File Format defined in the IS Participation Guide) containing the billing records of coupons included in the Auto-Billing Invoices. This Revenue Recognition File along with the optional ISR data is forwarded to the billing entity by SIS. SIS allows the billing entity to correct/update the values of the Auto-Billing invoices though the IS-WEB. Any update made on IS-WEB is reported back to the billing entity in the next Revenue Recognition File.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The Auto-Billed invoices are automatically closed and finalized by SIS and processed further like any other IS-IDEC/IS-XML invoices. At the end of the billing period, SIS generates an IS-IDEC file for the billing entity called Invoice Posting File which includes details of all Auto-Billed invoices. The billing entity can use it to carry out any account postings for such invoices within its Revenue Accounting/General Ledger System. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Billing Value Confirmation
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        This is also an optional service provided by SIS in conjunction with A&amp;A. This service validates the Passenger billing values against the prorate values stored within ATPCO. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS generates a Billing Value Confirmation file for passenger prime billing coupons where both the billing entity and billed entity are subscribers to this service. This file is forwarded to ATPCO for further processing. ATPCO validates the billing values with the prorate values stored within its database. Any exchange rate conversions of the prorate values as per the billing month will be done by ATPCO before comparing the values. The results of the comparison are updated by ATPCO and provided to SIS. SIS updates the comparison results within its Billing Record Database. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS automatically generates a Billing Value Confirmation report at the end of each billing period and provides it to the billing and billed entities.

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Digital Signature Application
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS offers digital signature (DS) application service through a trusted digital signature service provider (currently TrustWeaver). Based on the instructions provided by the billing entity, SIS creates from the IS-format invoice data an invoice subset file in PDF or XML format with the necessary legal and invoice information fields. This invoice subset file is forwarded to a trusted DS service provider in order to apply the appropriate digital signature. The file is sent immediately unless the file is incomplete (awaiting attachment). If there are attachments awaited, the file is not sent until all attachments have been uploaded and matched, or the billing deadline is reached, at which point the number of attachments reported is updated to reflect the number that are actually available at that time. The invoice is then sent for digital signature. After applying the digital signature, SIS receives the invoice subset file and stores it in its Central Repository. This digitally signed file is made available by SIS as one of the outputs to the billing entity at the end of the billing period, based on the configuration of the Member Profile. The file can also be downloaded online over the IS-WEB. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        4.5 Settlement Services 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application provides interfaces with industry clearing houses thus enabling automatic settlement of billed invoices as well as other clearing house related services. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Settlement Information
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application interfaces with two clearing houses: The IATA Clearing House (ICH), and the Airlines Clearing House (ACH). Based on the instructions provided by the billing entity, SIS generates a summary statement of the billed invoices and forwards it to the respective clearing house for settlement. In case of ICH, SIS generates claim files every 10 minutes whereas in case of ACH the settlement information is generated and passed only once at the billing period closure. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Suspended Member Billing Management
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS supports billings from or against entities that continue in business but have been suspended from the clearing house. The billing entities can continue to send invoices to be routed through the clearing house or for bilateral settlement. In case of billing from/to suspended members involving ICH, SIS will flag the invoices as “Suspended” in the summary settlement statement and forward them to ICH. The ICH will record this information in accordance with its procedures. In the case of billing from/to suspended members involving ACH, SIS will not include such invoice details at the time of creating the summary settlement statement, and no record will be retained by the ACH. When creating the SIS-Format output (IS-IDEC, IS-XML or IS-WEB), SIS flags such invoices as “Suspended” and forwards them to the billed entity along with the other invoices. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        In case of re-instatement of the suspended member, SIS provides the functionality for the billing entities to re-submit their claims and settle through the clearing house any outstanding amounts that arose after suspension. SIS also provides a report which helps the billing entities to manage the invoice claims made during the suspension period. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Handling Late Submission Billings
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS supports processing of invoices of closed billing periods for a short duration of time, immediately after the closure of the billing period. The designated person identified in the Member Profile can request invoices to be considered for Late Submission. On acceptance of such request by the clearing house, the invoices will automatically be considered for settlement. Clearing houses may charge a fee for such submissions.

    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        5.5 Reports 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS provides a number of reports to its members based on the payables data which can be used to analyze billing trends and volumes. These reports can be queried using a number of different criteria and saved in PDF or MS Excel format. 
    </p>


    <p class="bold">
        6. CORRESPONDENCE MANAGEMENT 
    </p>
    <p>
        As per the Interline billing rules defined in the RAM and ACH Manual of Procedure, once the maximum number of allowed rejections for a billing has been reached, the entity which received the last rejection can only continue the dispute by initiating correspondence. SIS will not permit further rejections after the limit has been reached. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        6.1 Generate Correspondence 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Once the maximum number of allowed rejections has been reached, the SIS application provides a facility by which the SIS Member, who received the last rejection, selects the rejection transaction/invoice on IS-WEB and initiates correspondence. The SIS application automatically populates the data in the correspondence screen based on the Member Profile information. SIS automatically generates a correspondence reference number which remains the same until the end of the correspondence cycle. SIS provides an option to the SIS Member to attach supporting documents to the correspondence. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS provides a facility by which the SIS Member user can save the correspondence in the draft stage and work on it later. SIS also provides a facility by which, if a user does not have the permission to send correspondence, can mark the correspondence as “Ready to Submit” and the supervisor can review, edit (if required) and send the correspondence. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        6.2 Receive Correspondence 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        When a correspondence is sent via SIS, an email notification is generated and is sent to the Correspondence Alert contact defined in the Member Profile for the specific Billing Category. The email only contains a URL reference, which on clicking, will open up the IS-WEB Correspondence screen (note: it may be necessary for the user to modify their junk/spam filters to enable these communications to be viewed/actioned). On reading the correspondence if the IS Member wants to continue with the correspondence process, SIS provides a facility by which a reply correspondence is generated and the SIS Member user is allowed to enter the details and send it to the interline partner. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS ensures that there is no out of turn correspondence done by the SIS Member User.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        6.3 Grant Authority to Bill for Correspondence 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS provides a facility where the SIS Member who received the 1st correspondence can grant an Authority to Bill when responding to the received correspondence. If the interline partner who received the Authority to Bill Correspondence is not satisfied with the amount for which the authority is granted, it can continue with the correspondence process and the Authority will be considered null and void. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        If the interline partner receiving the authority to bill accepts the amount for which authority is granted, the Member is expected to raise a Billing Memo/Correspondence Invoice and claim the amount for which the authority is granted. SIS validates the amount of such Billing Memos/Correspondence Invoices and matches it with the Authority amount. In case the two are not matching and the difference is more than the allowed tolerance, the invoice will fail in the Validation process. 
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        6.4 Expiry of Correspondence Cases 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS tracks the expiry dates of open correspondence cases in the system as per the rules defined in RAM/ACH Manual of Procedure. In case the party that initiated the 1st correspondence does not respond to a received correspondence by the expiry of the time limit, the Correspondence case is closed by SIS automatically with no further recourse through SIS for that particular case. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Similarly if an Authority to Bill was granted and the IS Member fails to raise the Billing Memo/Correspondence Invoice by the expiry time limit, SIS will close the correspondence case with no further recourse. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        In case the party who received the 1st correspondence fails to respond to a received correspondence by the expiry time limit, SIS will mark the correspondence case as Expired. The SIS Member who caused the expiry will not be allowed to respond to the correspondence any further by SIS. The other party has the right to raise a billing memo/Correspondence Invoice equal to the amount stated in the last correspondence sent which had expired. SIS validates the amount of such Billing Memos/Correspondence Invoices and matches it with the amount of the last correspondence. In case the two are not matching and the difference is more than the allowed tolerance, the invoice will fail in the validation process. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        In the above case if the SIS Member fails to raise the Billing Memo/Correspondence Invoice by the expiry time limit, SIS will close the correspondence case with no further recourse. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        6.5 Alerts and Reports 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Alerts
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS generates a number of alerts for the following correspondence cases; 
        <ul class="margin-6">
            <li>An email alert is generated and sent to all Correspondence Alert contacts when a new correspondence is received </li>
            <li>72 hours before expiry of a received correspondence, an alert is generated by IS informing the Correspondence Alert contacts </li>
            <li>72 hours before expiry of a draft correspondence, an alert is generated by IS informing the Correspondence Alert contacts </li>
            <li>For any received correspondence which has the Authority to Bill flag and a Billing Memo/Correspondence Invoice has not yet been raised two days prior to the expiry of this Correspondence </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Correspondence Alert Contact can be different for each Billing Category.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Reports
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS provides a Correspondence Status report allowing the users to track the details of the correspondence within the system. This report can be downloaded in PDF or Excel format.

However, if more time is needed, this will be advised to the respective users. Until April 2013, the legacy processes will be maintained and can be used as fall back option. Once an alternative is provided or normal functioning of the application is instituted, the IATA Help Desk will inform the participants and the Showstopper will be considered resolved.

            <p>
                <span class="bold">WHEREAS</span> the information technology solution resulting from the SIS Project to provide the air transport industry simplified, enhanced and optimized IATA settlement systems consists of: 
                <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                    <li>(i)	Pursuant to a SIS Participation Agreement between SIS Participants and International Air Transport Association (“IATA”), IATA shall provide billing and settlement services to SIS Participants which may involve the transfer of personal data to third countries for processing by IATA and its sub-processor, Accelya Kale Solutions Limited (“Accelya Kale”).</li>
                    <li>(ii)	For the purposes of Article 26(2) of Directive 95/46/EC for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection, certain SIS Participants (as data exporters) have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses with IATA (as data importer).</li>
                    <li>(iii)	Now, IATA and Accelya Kale wish to enter into these clauses to satisfy the sub-processing requirements of Clause 11 of the Standard Contractual Clauses. IATA and Accelya Kale intend these clauses to be valid as if Accelya Kale had countersigned Standard Contractual Clauses with individual SIS Participants, as envisaged by Clause 11.</li>

                <li>(c)	‘the data importer’ means the processor who agrees to receive from the data exporter personal data intended for processing on his behalf after the transfer in accordance with his instructions and the terms of the Clauses and who is not subject to a third country's system ensuring adequate protection within the meaning of Article 25(1) of Directive 95/46/EC;</li>
                <li>(d)	‘the sub-processor’ means any processor engaged by the data importer or by any other subprocessor of the data importer who agrees to receive from the data importer or from any other sub-processor of the data importer personal data exclusively intended for processing activities to be carried out on behalf of the data exporter after the transfer in accordance with his instructions, the terms of the Clauses and the terms of the written subcontract;</li>
                <li>(e)	‘the applicable data protection law’ means the legislation protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and, in particular, their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data applicable to a data controller in the Member State in which the data exporter is established;</li>
                <li>(f)	‘technical and organisational security measures’ means those measures aimed at protecting personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing.</li>

The data subject can enforce against the data importer this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where the data exporter has factually disappeared or has ceased to exist in law unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law, as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity.</li>
                <li>3.	The data subject can enforce against the sub-processor this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity. Such third-party liability of the sub-processor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.</li>
                <li>4.	The parties do not object to a data subject being represented by an association or other body if the data subject so expressly wishes and if permitted by national law.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="bold margin-3">Clause 4 Obligations of the data exporter</p>

                <li>(a)	that the processing, including the transfer itself, of the personal data has been and will continue to be carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of the applicable data protection law (and, where applicable, has been notified to the relevant authorities of the Member State where the data exporter is established) and does not violate the relevant provisions of that State;</li>
                <li>(b)	that it has instructed and throughout the duration of the personal data processing services will instruct the data importer to process the personal data transferred only on the data exporter's behalf and in accordance with the applicable data protection law and the Clauses; </li>

                <li>(e)	that it will ensure compliance with the security measures;</li>
                <li>(f)	that, if the transfer involves special categories of data, the data subject has been informed or will be informed before, or as soon as possible after, the transfer that its data could be transmitted to a third country not providing adequate protection within the meaning of Directive 95/46/EC;</li>

If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his sub-processor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract of by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity.

If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the sub-processor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the sub-processor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data sub-processor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The liability of the sub-processor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.</li>

                    <ul class="margin-3" style="list-style-type: none;">
                        <li>(a) to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable, by the supervisory authority;</li>

            <ul class="margin-3" style="list-style-type: none;">
                <li>1.	The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law.</li>
                <li>2.	The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any sub-processor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law.</li>
                <li>3.	The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any sub-processor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any sub-processor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5 (b).</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="bold margin-3">Clause 9 Governing Law</p>
            <p class="margin-3">The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.</p>

            <p class="bold margin-3">Clause 10 Variation of the contract</p>
            <p class="margin-3">The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause.</p>

            <p class="bold margin-3">Clause 11 Sub-processing</p>
            <ul class="margin-3" style="list-style-type: none;">
                <li>1.	The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the sub-processor which imposes the same obligations on the sub-processor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses . Where the sub-processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processor's obligations under such agreement.</li>
                <li>2.	The prior written contract between the data importer and the sub-processor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such thirdparty liability of the sub-processor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.</li>
                <li>3.	The provisions relating to data protection aspects for sub-processing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.</li>
                <li>4.	The data exporter shall keep a list of sub-processing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter's data protection supervisory authority.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="bold margin-3">Clause 12 Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services</p>

The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the data importer and the sub-processor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.</li>
                <li>2.	The data importer and the sub-processor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.</li>
