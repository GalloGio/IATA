    <p>
        The Service will be run on an operational cost-recovery basis, and the fees are subject to adjustment to ensure that operational costs are recovered. The prices below are effective 01 January 2019 and reflect the current best estimate of the charges necessary to operate the SIS Solution on a cost-recovery basis. As more information is made available to IATA about the estimated and actual use of the Service, prices will be adjusted in order to maintain neutral revenue. The annual accounts of the SIS operations covering the actual and planned cost and revenues will be shared with the SG in a timely manner.

        1: The charge for auto-billing request does not include the invoice and prime coupons that are then submitted on the carrier's behalf; those are charged additionally at the described rates.
    </p>
    <p>
        * All transactions entered via the IS-WEB interface and not via IS-IDEC or IS-XML (including Correspondence, which are only entered via IS-WEB) will be charged an additional 25%. This surcharge will not apply to supporting documents uploaded via the IS-WEB interface.

    <p>
        Additional Notes on the Service Transaction Fees: 
        <ul>
            <li>For the purposes of determining the proper category, fees will only take into account the Service transactional charges and not any annual fee paid. </li>
            <li>Digital signature charges may be payable by both the billing and billed Participant based on their selections. </li>
            <li>Supporting Document charges are based on the stored document size (documents are stored unzipped), not the transmitted document size (documents are transmitted zipped). </li>
            <li>Where twelve months of data is not available, the Base charging band will be applied, and re-assessed quarterly on an annualised volume basis until twelve months history is available. </li>
            <li>Effective January 2018 - Rejection Memo, Billing Memo and Credit Memo charges are based on the count of memo coupon/AWB breakdowns instead of RM/BM/CM memo counts. </li>
            <li>A&amp;A fees are not included in the above figures and will be charged separately by A&amp;A. The “Value Determination” and “Auto-billing” features of Integrated Settlement require the storage option from A&amp;A. </li>

        1.1 This attachment describes the Additional Services that the Participant elects to use in addition to the provision of the Service under the main agreement. This annex may be amended at any time by the Participant and communicated to IATA in order to reflect the changes in its selection of Additional Services.

        3. OPTIONAL SERVICES 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        3.1 Digital Signature application 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS offers a digital signature (DS) application service in a number of countries with the help of a trusted digital signature service provider. Based on the instructions provided by the billing entity, SIS creates an invoice subset file from the SIS-format invoice data with the necessary legal and invoice information fields. This digitally signed file is made available by SIS as one of the outputs to the billing entity at the end of the billing period, based on the configuration of the Member Profile. It can also be downloaded online over the IS-WEB.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS allows billed entities to configure the application of Digital Signature on Payable Invoices in the Member Profile. Based on the location details specified on the payable invoice, SIS triggers the process to apply digital signature in the countries covered by the service. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        3.2 Digital Signature verification 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS provides an option whereby the billed entity can request verification of the digital signature applied on Payable Invoices, via the Member Profile. A verification log file is created by this process which contains the status of the applied digital signature in the countries covered by the service. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        3.3 Legal Archiving (or E-Archiving) service 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Some jurisdictions may require legal storage for the digitally signed invoices for varying amounts of time. During this period, the invoices and any applicable digital signature need to be accessible for any audits. To address this issue, SIS will provide an optional Legal Archiving service to store the digitally signed invoices and other related information on behalf of the Participant in an external Legal archive for a longer period as required by the local regulations. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        3.4 Billing Value Determination 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        As part of this service, SIS accepts Usage Files (modified Record 50 file format as defined in the IS Participation guide) from billing entities requesting prorate values for coupons utilized by them. SIS validates the file format and forwards the Usage File to ATPCO for further processing. The processed information is provided by ATPCO back to SIS. IS forwards the output files provided by ATPCO to the billing entities. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        3.5 Billing Value Confirmation 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS generates a Billing Value Confirmation file for passenger prime billing coupons where both the billing entity and billed entity are subscribers to this service. This file is forwarded to ATPCO for further processing. ATPCO validates the billing values with the prorate values stored within its database. Any exchange rate conversions of the prorate values as per the billing month will be done by ATPCO before comparing the values. The results of the comparison are updated by ATPCO and provided to SIS. SIS updates the comparison results within its Billing Record Database. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        3.6 Auto-billing 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        As part of this service, SIS will store the prorate records received through the Value Determination process and generate invoices on behalf of the Billing Entity. On a daily basis SIS will generate a Revenue Recognition File (File Format defined in the IS Participation Guide) containing the billing records of coupons included in the Auto-Billing Invoices. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The Auto-Billed invoices are automatically closed and finalized by SIS and processed further like any other IS-IDEC/IS-XML invoices. At the end of the billing period, SIS generates an Invoice Posting File which includes details of all Auto-Billed invoices

        ATTACHMENT D — SIMPLIFIED INVOICING AND SETTLEMENT (SIS) SERVICE DESCRIPTION
    </h2>

    <p class="bold">
        Simplified Invoicing and Settlement (SIS) Service Description
    </p>

    <p class="bold">
        1. BACKGROUND 
    </p>
    <p>
        The SIS project aims to simplify interline billing, and to remove paper from the entire process, delivering tangible financial benefits to the industry. The vision is that a billing entity will submit a single electronic billing file that will be converted into an invoice and a settlement file, sent to the billed entity, and cleared through the relevant clearing house. As part of this project, an “Simplified Invoicing and Settlement” (SIS) System has been developed based on the principles of completely paperless billing, invoicing, and settlement. The SIS solution encompasses Passenger, Cargo, Miscellaneous and UATP interline billings with settlements through ICH, ACH or on a bilateral basis. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In this document the terms Simplified Invoicing and Settlement (SIS) and Integrated Settlement (IS) may be used interchangeably and the term IS Member(s) has the same meaning as Participant and/or SIS Participants, as the case may be. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        1.1 Overview of Simplified Invoicing and Settlement (SIS) 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS is an Invoicing Platform which is connected to various external systems such as ICH, ACH, ATPCO, a trusted Digital Signature service provider, etc., thus providing a single point of communication for Interline billing, invoicing and settlement. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        A high level overview of SIS is shown in Figure 1 below: 
    </p>

    <figure>
        <apex:image width="680" value="{!URLFOR($Resource.ISSP_MembershipApplicationFormPDF,'img/ISPA_figure1.jpg')}"/>
        <figcaption>Figure: Overview of Simplified Invoicing and Settlement (SIS)</figcaption>
    </figure> 

    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application can be grouped into the following logical modules: 
        <ul>
            <li>SIS Member and User Management </li>
            <li>Receivables Data Processing </li>
            <li>Payables Data Processing </li>
            <li>Correspondence Management </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        The services provided by each module are described in the subsequent chapters.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        1.2 Supporting Documentation 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The following documents provide additional information to the services described in this document:
        <ul>
            <li>SIS Participation Guide: This document provides the details of the impact of SIS on the IT systems and processes of the SIS Members. </li>
            <li>Sign up and Certification Guide: This document provides detail explanation on the Sign up process and steps to be followed to get certified for SIS. </li>
            <li>IATA Revenue Accounting Manual (RAM): The RAM contains all the rules and procedures associated with interline billing, with which the IS application will be compliant, and of which the SIS Participation Agreement and this Attachment are a part. </li>
            <li>ACH Manual of Procedure: For members of the ACH, the Manual of Procedure contains all the rules and procedures associated with billings using the ACH for settlement. </li>
            <li>SIS User Guide: This manual documents all the functional processes of SIS that are available to the individual user. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        1.3 Standard Services and Optional Services 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Standard Services such as submission of invoices, flight coupon data, air waybill data, rejections etc. are available to any Member as soon as participation formalities have been completed. Optional Services require specific notification or request to SIS Operations (SIS-Ops), whether before or after use of the service has commenced. Use of optional services will incur additional charges (such as Digital Signatures) and may also require secondary agreements to be signed (such as for A&amp;A services). Because a service is shown as ‘Optional’ in SIS does not mean that it is optional in the Members operating jurisdictions. 
    </p>

    <p class="bold">
        2. MEMBER AND USER MANAGEMENT 
    </p>
    <p>
        The SIS application allows SIS Members to configure their company and staff responsibility details using the Member Profile module over IS-WEB. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        2.1 Member Creation 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The initial set-up of SIS Member is done by SIS-Ops using existing information within IATA, ICH, ACH etc. as well as using information sourced from individual members during the sign-up process. This is done for all airline entities defined in the Airline Coding Database as well as non-airline entities who are members of ICH and/or ACH. Once the participation formalities are completed, the Membership status is activated by SIS-Ops and a Super user account is created and provided to the
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS Member. Login credentials to access IS-WEB as well as the FTP server (if required) are also provided by SIS-Ops so that the SIS Member can communicate with the SIS Platform. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Note:
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS Member will have to go through the Sandbox Testing and Certification process to be able to send invoice files to SIS. This process is described in detail in the SIS Sign Up and Certification Guide.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        2.2 Member Profile Set-up 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Using the login credentials provided by SIS-Ops, the SIS Member can login to IS-WEB and review the set-up details on the Member Profile Screen. SIS allows the SIS Member to update the details on the Member Profile. Certain fields on the Member Profile will only allow changes to be made which will be applicable for a future billing period or date. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6 bold">
        Member Details
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6">
        SIS application will allow the SIS Member to upload and store its official logo on to its platform. This logo will be used by SIS to display the image on the PDF invoices generated on behalf of the SIS Member. The Member's Accounting Code, Prefix, Legal Name, Status in SIS, IATA, the ICH, or the ACH, and the details of the Member's bank accounts for bilateral settlements cannot be changed by the SIS Member and must be referred to SIS-Ops. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6 bold">
        Location Details
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6">
        Every SIS Member needs to have at least one location detail setup in the Member Profile. This will be the default location of the SIS Member and is referred to as the “MAIN” location. The SIS Member will be allowed to update the details of the MAIN location as well as create any additional location details that may be required for legal or business reasons. This information is used at the time of PDF Invoice generation as well as when generating the Payable output invoices, in case the invoice reference data is not provided in the incoming receivables invoice. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6 bold">
        Bank Details for Bilateral Settlement
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6">
        Bank details can be set-up against each location created in the Member Profile to be used in case of bilateral settlement invoices. This set-up can only be done by SIS-Ops based on signed physical requests from the SIS Members. This information is included by SIS in the Payable Invoice in case of Bilateral Settlement. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6 bold">
        Contacts
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6">
        SIS allows set-up of two types of contacts in the Member Profile: 
        <ul class="margin-9">
            <li>Informational Contacts: These contacts are set up for purely informational purposes, For example Passenger RA Manager, etc. The contact details include information such as the name, designation, address, contact numbers, email id etc. of that person. The SIS application allows IS Members to retrieve the informational contacts of other SIS Members. As part of the initial data set-up, SIS-Ops will configure some of the informational contacts of the SIS Member based on the data available within IATA (RAM, ACH Manual of Procedure, ICH database, etc.). </li>
            <li>Processing Contacts: These contacts, if set up by the SIS Member, will receive email alerts on specific events related to invoice processing e.g. Passenger File Receipt Alert Contact, Cargo Correspondence Alert Contact etc. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6 bold">
        E-invoicing and Billing Category Specific Details
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6">
        SIS allows the SIS Member to set-up Billing Category and e-invoicing specific parameters on the Member Profile which control the behavior of the SIS application at the time of processing. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6 bold">
        Clearing House Specific Details
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6">
        SIS allows view access to the Clearing House set-up details to the SIS Members. This information can only be updated by the respective clearing house operations team members. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6 bold">
        Technical Details
    </p>
    <p class="margin-6">
        The SIS application allows the SIS Members to store the login credentials of the ftp servers/iiNET where the output files needs to be provided. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        2.3 User Set-up 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS platform allows different type of users to be configured in the system. These include:
        <ol class="margin-6">
            <li>SIS Member Users </li>
            <li>SIS-Ops Users </li>
            <li>ICH Ops Users </li>
            <li>ACH Ops Users </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Depending on the type of the user, the IS-WEB Menu structure and the Screens changes accordingly. The User profile details stored in SIS includes the name, location details, email id, contact number etc of the person. The email id of the user acts as the login id for IS-WEB. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        In case of SIS Member Users, SIS-Ops creates a Member Super User account once the participation formalities are completed. This Member Super User can create other Users for the SIS Member. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        2.4 Assign Permissions 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS Platform will assign the maximum permission allowed for a SIS Member User to the SIS Member Super User Account. The SIS Member Super User, at the time of creating other users, can assign permissions to the users. These include permissions for viewing/editing information on a particular screen, permission to perform some special operations on specific screens, permission to create other users etc. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application will have default templates to assign permissions, which can be used by SIS Member users to assign permissions. Member Users will also have the ability to create their own permission templates and apply them to their users. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application also provides a facility to copy the user permission profile from one user and replicate them on other users. 
    </p>

    <p class="bold">
        3. DATA TRANSMISSION 
    </p>
All files to and from SIS will be processed initially by iiNet on behalf of SIS. Files will be received by iiNet from all Members, and will be transmitted by iiNet to the SIS application. Once the file is received correctly by iiNet, iiNet will complete delivery to the SIS application. Any files to be transmitted to a Member will be sent by the SIS application to iiNet, and will be transmitted from iiNet to the Member. 
Files from the Member must be pushed to iiNet, and files from iiNet to the Member may be pushed by iiNet or pulled by the Member at the Member's choice. 
There are no fees for this service provided by iiNet for files transmitted from and to SIS, but usage will require separate acceptance of the iiNet Terms Of Use. Any added-value services provided by iiNet beyond transmission between the SIS Member and SIS are subject to iiNet's normal terms and conditions, and fees may be applicable. 
    <p class="bold">
        4. RECEIVABLES PROCESSING 
    </p>
The SIS application will process the incoming invoices and supporting documents provided by the billing entities for all four Interline Billing Categories (Passenger, Cargo, Miscellaneous and UATP). 
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        4.1 Invoice Data Processing 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Input Possibilities
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application allows the billing entities to provide invoice information in multiple electronic formats. In the case of Passenger and Cargo billings, the invoice information can be provided in a flat file based structure (IS-IDEC) or in an XML file format (IS-XML). Miscellaneous and UATP invoices can be submitted only in the IS-XML format. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Along with the electronic mode of invoice submission, SIS will also provide a facility to manually capture and review invoice information online over the internet, named IS-WEB. The table below details the support provided by SIS for different type of transactions within each Billing Category.

    </center>

    <p class="margin-3">
        On successful receipt of an incoming file, SIS generates a confirmation email and sends it to the billing entity. This email alert can be configured by billing entity using the Member Profile screen on IS-WEB. 
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        In case of invoices captured over IS-WEB, SIS generates an email alert to the billing entity 24 hours before the billing period closure providing a list of open invoices yet to be submitted for further processing. 
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Data Validation
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        Invoice data provided by the billing entities will be validated by SIS. This process will ensure that the invoice data is of good quality and the billed entities can process the same without any issue within their internal systems. This process will take place upon receipt of each SIS billing file. 
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        The different types of validation checks performed by the IS application are as follows: 
    </p>
    <ul class="margin-6">
        <li>File Construction checks: SIS will validate if the invoice files are created as per the defined file specifications, naming convention, duplicate files, compression logic, etc </li>
        <li>Field Format checks: SIS will check if data values have been provided for mandatory data elements, conditionally mandatory data elements if the condition is met, etc. It will also ensure that the data is provided as per the field format (e.g. numeric, alphabetic, date, etc) and as per the field length specifications (e.g. numeric field with a maximum of 5 digits) </li>
        <li>Reference Master checks: Invoice data fields having standard reference data values are valid (e.g. From City field if populated should have a valid IATA city/airport code, etc) </li>
        <li>Interline Billing Rules checks: Some of the Interline billing rules defined in the RAM or ACH Manual of Procedure, such as possible duplicate billing check, outside time limit billings, minimum billing amount check for different type of transaction, etc. </li>
        <li>Settlement Information checks: SIS will validate the correctness of the Settlement details provided on the invoice if it needs to be cleared through a clearing house (e.g. Currency of Clearance information, Clearing House information, etc). </li>
        <li>Billing Audit Trail checks: SIS will check if the various stages of billing are linked together and there are no out of turn billings (e.g. validation of ‘Previous Invoice number’, ‘Previous Billing Month’, ‘Previous Rejection number’, ‘Rejection Stage number’ in case of Rejections etc) </li>
        <li>Computation checks: SIS will validate if billing amounts specified at various levels within the invoice add up together (e.g. the invoice total adds up to the sum of all Line Item totals, similarly Line Item total adds up to the sum of all Line Item details totals etc). The total of the line items must not vary from the invoice value by more than a small tolerance. </li>
        <li>Legal Requirement checks: SIS will validate if certain legal requirements are satisfied by the Billing Entity in the invoice data (e.g. invoice Number is unique for a Billing Member within a calendar year, VAT breakdown information is provided in the case that VAT amounts are billed in the invoice, etc) </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Wherever possible, SIS will validate the entire file and identify all possible errors in the file. A validation report is generated at the end of this process and is provided to Billing Entity irrespective of the status of the validation. In case of errors, the Billing Entity can configure its Member Profile to receive an email alerting its contact about the details of the Validation error. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Invoice data captured using IS-WEB is validated at the time of data entry. SIS will alert the user in case invalid data in entered at the time of saving the information. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS Platform does not validate the following: 
    </p>
    <ul class="margin-6">
        <li>Whether the entity can legally bill the invoice through SIS </li>
        <li>Whether the billed amounts are correct </li>
        <li>Whether all required taxes are applied correctly </li>
        <li>Whether all required legal information of all countries in the world is provided </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Error Handling
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        In case of validation error, SIS provides a facility to delete the erroneous invoices or the entire file through IS-WEB. For certain errors, SIS also provides an option of carrying out online correction on the IS-WEB. These correctable errors are errors related to reference data values such as invalid city/airport code, invalid tax code etc. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Invoices in an error status are not considered for further processing by SIS.

    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Input Possibilities
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS provides the facility for billing entities to supply supporting documents in electronic format in both batch and as online modes. At the time of invoice capture, billing entities can manually upload the supporting documents. SIS will store the uploaded supporting documents and link them to the invoice, or to the transaction within the invoice. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS supports 3 indexing options for submitting supporting documents in a batch mode. These are: 
        <ul class="margin-6">

    <p class="margin-3">
        Billing entities can use any of the options to submit the batch supporting documents to SIS. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        On successful receipt of a batch supporting file, SIS generates a confirmation email and sends it to the billing entity.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Data Validation
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS carries out certain sanity checks on the batch supporting document file before it is considered for processing. The different type of checks includes the following: 
        <ul class="margin-6">
            <li>File Construction checks: SIS will validate if the batch supporting documents files are created as per the defined file specifications, naming convention, duplicate files, compression logic, etc </li>
            <li>Index Information checks: SIS will validate the index information supplied with the batch supporting documents files and confirm if it is as per the defined specification. </li>
            <li>File Extension checks: SIS will validate the file extensions of the individual supporting documents and check if it matches with one of the supported neutral file formats. In case it is not a neutral file format, SIS will validate if any exceptions for supporting document file types have been defined in the Member Profile of the billed entity for acceptance. If it is not an exception, SIS will delete the supporting document file from the system. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Wherever possible, SIS will validate the entire file and identify all possible issues in the batch supporting document file. A validation report is generated at the end of this process and is provided to the billing entity. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Automated Linking of Supporting Documents
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application will carry out auto-linking of supporting documents provided in a batch mode to the corresponding billing record. This linking will be based on the Index information supplied in the batch supporting document file. Invoices which are successfully validated will be considered for automated linking. SIS will take care of any timing issues in case of automated linking if the supporting document file is provided prior to the invoice being successfully validated. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        For cases where the SIS application is not able to automatically link the supporting documents, SIS provides a facility by which the billing entity can update the linking information on IS-WEB and manually trigger the linking process.

        4.3 Value Determination, Auto-Billing and Billing Value Confirmation 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Value Determination
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        This is an optional service provided by SIS in conjunction with A&amp;A which can be utilized by Passenger billing entities that store prorated coupon values within ARC COMPASS®. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        As part of this service, SIS accepts Usage Files (modified Record 50 file format as defined in the SIS Participation guide) from billing entities requesting prorate values for coupons utilized by them. SIS validates the file format and forwards the Usage File to ATPCO for further processing. The processed information is provided by ATPCO back to SIS. SIS forwards the output files provided by ATPCO to the billing entities. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Internally SIS keeps track of which transactions were provided by the billing entities for processing and which transactions were processed and returned by ATPCO. On a daily basis SIS creates a report highlighting transactions where a response is not provided by ATPCO as per the defined timelines, and provides it to the billing entities. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Auto-Billing
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Auto-Billing is an optional service provided by SIS in conjunction with A&amp;A and is an extension of the Value Determination process. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        As part of this service, SIS will store the prorate records received through the Value Determination process and generate invoices on behalf of the Billing Entity. On a daily basis SIS will generate a Revenue Recognition File (File Format defined in the IS Participation Guide) containing the billing records of coupons included in the Auto-Billing Invoices. This Revenue Recognition File along with the optional ISR data is forwarded to the billing entity by SIS. SIS allows the billing entity to correct/update the values of the Auto-Billing invoices though the IS-WEB. Any update made on IS-WEB is reported back to the billing entity in the next Revenue Recognition File.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The Auto-Billed invoices are automatically closed and finalized by SIS and processed further like any other IS-IDEC/IS-XML invoices. At the end of the billing period, SIS generates an IS-IDEC file for the billing entity called Invoice Posting File which includes details of all Auto-Billed invoices. The billing entity can use it to carry out any account postings for such invoices within its Revenue Accounting/General Ledger System. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Billing Value Confirmation
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        This is also an optional service provided by SIS in conjunction with A&amp;A. This service validates the Passenger billing values against the prorate values stored within ATPCO. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS generates a Billing Value Confirmation file for passenger prime billing coupons where both the billing entity and billed entity are subscribers to this service. This file is forwarded to ATPCO for further processing. ATPCO validates the billing values with the prorate values stored within its database. Any exchange rate conversions of the prorate values as per the billing month will be done by ATPCO before comparing the values. The results of the comparison are updated by ATPCO and provided to SIS. SIS updates the comparison results within its Billing Record Database. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS automatically generates a Billing Value Confirmation report at the end of each billing period and provides it to the billing and billed entities.

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Digital Signature Application
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS offers digital signature (DS) application service through a trusted digital signature service provider (currently TrustWeaver). Based on the instructions provided by the billing entity, SIS creates from the IS-format invoice data an invoice subset file in PDF or XML format with the necessary legal and invoice information fields. This invoice subset file is forwarded to a trusted DS service provider in order to apply the appropriate digital signature. The file is sent immediately unless the file is incomplete (awaiting attachment). If there are attachments awaited, the file is not sent until all attachments have been uploaded and matched, or the billing deadline is reached, at which point the number of attachments reported is updated to reflect the number that are actually available at that time. The invoice is then sent for digital signature. After applying the digital signature, SIS receives the invoice subset file and stores it in its Central Repository. This digitally signed file is made available by SIS as one of the outputs to the billing entity at the end of the billing period, based on the configuration of the Member Profile. The file can also be downloaded online over the IS-WEB. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 indent-1_5 bold">
        4.5 Settlement Services 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application provides interfaces with industry clearing houses thus enabling automatic settlement of billed invoices as well as other clearing house related services. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Settlement Information
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application interfaces with two clearing houses: The IATA Clearing House (ICH), and the Airlines Clearing House (ACH). Based on the instructions provided by the billing entity, SIS generates a summary statement of the billed invoices and forwards it to the respective clearing house for settlement. In case of ICH, SIS generates claim files every 10 minutes whereas in case of ACH the settlement information is generated and passed only once at the billing period closure. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Suspended Member Billing Management
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS supports billings from or against entities that continue in business but have been suspended from the clearing house. The billing entities can continue to send invoices to be routed through the clearing house or for bilateral settlement. In case of billing from/to suspended members involving ICH, SIS will flag the invoices as “Suspended” in the summary settlement statement and forward them to ICH. The ICH will record this information in accordance with its procedures. In the case of billing from/to suspended members involving ACH, SIS will not include such invoice details at the time of creating the summary settlement statement, and no record will be retained by the ACH. When creating the SIS-Format output (IS-IDEC, IS-XML or IS-WEB), SIS flags such invoices as “Suspended” and forwards them to the billed entity along with the other invoices. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        In case of re-instatement of the suspended member, SIS provides the functionality for the billing entities to re-submit their claims and settle through the clearing house any outstanding amounts that arose after suspension. SIS also provides a report which helps the billing entities to manage the invoice claims made during the suspension period. 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Handling Late Submission Billings
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS supports processing of invoices of closed billing periods for a short duration of time, immediately after the closure of the billing period. The designated person identified in the Member Profile can request invoices to be considered for Late Submission. On acceptance of such request by the clearing house, the invoices will automatically be considered for settlement. Clearing houses may charge a fee for such submissions.

        Once the maximum number of allowed rejections has been reached, the SIS application provides a facility by which the SIS Member, who received the last rejection, selects the rejection transaction/invoice on IS-WEB and initiates correspondence. The SIS application automatically populates the data in the correspondence screen based on the Member Profile information. SIS automatically generates a correspondence reference number which remains the same until the end of the correspondence cycle. SIS provides an option to the SIS Member to attach supporting documents to the correspondence.

        If the interline partner receiving the authority to bill accepts the amount for which authority is granted, the Member is expected to raise a Billing Memo/Correspondence Invoice and claim the amount for which the authority is granted. SIS validates the amount of such Billing Memos/Correspondence Invoices and matches it with the Authority amount. In case the two are not matching and the difference is more than the allowed tolerance, the invoice will fail in the Validation process.

        In case the party who received the 1st correspondence fails to respond to a received correspondence by the expiry time limit, SIS will mark the correspondence case as Expired. The SIS Member who caused the expiry will not be allowed to respond to the correspondence any further by SIS. The other party has the right to raise a billing memo/Correspondence Invoice equal to the amount stated in the last correspondence sent which had expired. SIS validates the amount of such Billing Memos/Correspondence Invoices and matches it with the amount of the last correspondence. In case the two are not matching and the difference is more than the allowed tolerance, the invoice will fail in the validation process.

        <span class="bold">Showstoppers (Severity 1):</span> Showstopper faults are those which prevent global use of the application software or which stop an operational function of application globally, thereby preventing the users from completing essential operations. IATA will endeavour to provide a resolution, either in the form of a workaround or a patch in that order of priority, within six (6) hours. However, if more time is needed, this will be advised to the respective users. Until April 2013, the legacy processes will be maintained and can be used as fall back option. Once an alternative is provided or normal functioning of the application is instituted, the IATA Help Desk will inform the participants and the Showstopper will be considered resolved.
