        3.1.3 Participation in this Agreement is conditional upon User agreeing that IATA will be generating electronic invoices on User’s behalf, and on agreeing to accept electronic invoices via the Solution. Invoices are deemed to be received as soon as notification has been sent to the recipient of the invoice. It is User’s responsibility to secure any permissions or authorizations that may be required in its country or countries of base regarding the use of electronic invoices, and to comply with laws that those countries may apply to the creation of invoices, determination of applicable taxes, management of access controls, record keeping and legal archiving. The correctness of any User Data (as defined in Section 3.3) submitted to the Service and/or Additional Services remains the responsibility of User at all times. Where electronic signatures have been requested, User authorizes IATA to apply or validate the electronic signature through the electronic signature service providers listed in <span class="underline">Attachment A</span> and as amended from time to time. 
    </p>

    <p class="margin-6 indent-3">

    </p>

    <p class="margin-6 indent-3">
        3.1.6 User acknowledges that settlement through IATA settlement systems of electronically submitted invoices via the Service could generate an automatic default notice if payment is made by any user of the Service and/or Additional Service when not based on the gross amount of the invoice, but on the gross amount net of deduction or withholdings based on taxes or other governmental charges.

    <p class="margin-6 indent-3">
        3.1.7 In supplying User Data, User shall comply with the procedures and standards provided for in this Agreement.

For the purposes of this Agreement, “<span class="bold">Personal Data</span>” means any data, which permits the identification of an individual. IATA hereby notifies User of such Processing and User hereby grants consent required for the Processing of Personal Data. User agrees that IATA shall not be in breach of this Agreement if IATA refuses to perform any transaction offered as part of the Service and/or Additional Services described in this Agreement to User when User’s employee, agent and/or representative refuses to consent to the Processing of its necessary Personal Data for the performance of such transaction(s).

        1. BACKGROUND
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS platform exists to simplify air transport industry billing and to remove paper from the entire process, delivering tangible financial benefits to all participants in the industry. The SIS platform enables a service provider to generate a single electronic billing file that can be converted to a series of standard-format electronic invoices that can be read and processed automatically by the recipient. Settlement through industry clearing house is automatically enabled, so that members can incorporate immediate settlement if agreed between them. Dispute mechanisms and agreed procedures for both invoicing and settlement are included as part of the service.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        In providing this service, IATA aims to simplify and accelerate industry processes, increasing efficiency and reducing costs for all participants.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        1.1 OVERVIEW OF SIS)
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS is an Invoicing Platform which is connected to various external systems such as ICH, ACH, a trusted Digital Signature service provider, etc., thus providing a single point of communication for industry billing, invoicing and settlement.
        A high level overview of Integrated Settlement is shown in Figure 1 below:
    </p>

    <figure>
        <apex:image width="680" value="{!URLFOR($Resource.ISSP_MembershipApplicationFormPDF,'img/ISUA_figure1.png')}"/>
        <figcaption>Figure : Overview of Integrated Settlement</figcaption>
    </figure> 

    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application can be grouped into the following logical modules:
        <ul>
            <li>User and User Management</li>
            <li>Receivables Data Processing</li>
            <li>Payables Data Processing</li>
            <li>Dispute Management (known in IS as ‘Correspondence’)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The services provided by each module are described in the subsequent chapters.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        1.2 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        The following documents provide additional information to the services described in this document:
        <ul class="margin-6">
            <li>SIS Implementation Handbook: This document provides the details of the impact of IS on the IT systems and processes of the Users</li>
            <li>IS-XML Structure and Interface Specification: This document describes the format of the IS-XML electronic invoice.</li>
            <li>Sign up and Certification Guide: This document provides detail explanation on the Sign up process and steps to be followed to get certified for SIS.</li>
            <li>ACH Manual of Procedure: For members of the ACH, the Manual of Procedure contains all the rules and procedures associated with billings using the ACH for settlement</li>
            <li>SIS User Guide: This manual documents all the functional processes of SIS that are available to the individual user.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        1.3 STANDARD SERVICES AND OPTIONAL SERVICES
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        Standard Services such as submission of invoices, rejections etc. are available to any User as soon as participation formalities have been completed. Optional Services require specific notification or request to IATA, whether before or after use of the service has commenced. Use of optional services will incur additional charges (such as Digital Signatures). Because a service is shown as ‘Optional’ in SIS does not mean that it is optional in the User’s operating jurisdictions.
    </p>

    <p class="bold">
        2. USER MANAGEMENT
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application allows Users to configure their company and staff responsibility details using the User Profile module over IS-WEB.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        2.1 USER CREATION
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        The initial set-up of the User is done by IATA using existing information within IATA as well as using information sourced from individual participants during the sign-up process. Once the participation formalities are completed, the participation status is activated by SIS-Ops and a Super User account is created and provided to the User. Login credentials to access IS-WEB are also provided by IATA so that the User can communicate with the SIS Platform. 
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: The User will have to go through the Sandbox Testing and Certification process to be able to send invoice files to SIS. This process is described in detail in the SIS Sign Up and Certification Guide.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        2.2 USER PROFILE SET-UP
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        Using the login credentials provided by SIS-Ops, the User can login to IS-WEB and review the set-up details on the Member Profile Screen. SIS allows the User to update the details on the Member Profile. Certain fields on the Member Profile will only allow changes to be made which will be applicable for a future billing period or date. 
    </p>

    <div class="bold margin-3">Member Details</div>
    <p class="margin-3">
    SIS application will allow the User to upload and store its official logo on to its platform. This logo will be used by SIS to display the image on the PDF invoices generated on behalf of the User. The User’s Accounting Code, Prefix, Legal Name, Status in IS,  the ICH, or the ACH, and the details of the User’s bank accounts for bilateral settlements cannot be changed by the User and must be referred to SIS-Ops.
    </p>

    <div class="bold margin-3">Location Details</div>
     <p class="margin-3">
        Every User needs to have at least one location detail setup in the User Profile. This will be the default location of the User and is referred to as the “MAIN” location. The User will be allowed to update the details of the MAIN location as well as create any additional location details that may be required for legal or business reasons. This information is used at the time of PDF Invoice generation as well as when generating the Payable output invoices, in case the invoice reference data is not provided in the incoming receivables invoice.
    </p>

    <div class="bold margin-3">Bank Details for Bilateral Settlement</div>
     <p class="margin-3">
        Bank details can be set-up against each location created in the Member Profile to be used in case of bilateral settlement invoices. This set-up can only be done by SIS-Ops based on signed physical requests from the Users. This information is included by SIS in the Payable Invoice in case of Bilateral Settlement.
    </p>

    <div class="bold margin-3">Contacts</div>
     <p class="margin-3">
        SIS allows set-up of two types of contacts in the Member Profile:
        <ul>
            <li>Informational Contacts: These contacts are set up for purely informational purposes. The contact details include information such as the name, designation, address, contact numbers, email id etc. of that person. The SIS application allows Users to retrieve the informational contacts of other service participants. As part of the initial data set-up, SIS-Ops will configure some of the informational contacts of the User based on the data available within IATA. </li>
            <li>Processing Contacts: These contacts, if set up by the User, will receive email alerts on specific events related to invoice processing. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <div class="bold margin-3">E-invoicing Specific Details</div>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS allows the User to set-up e-invoicing specific parameters on the User Profile which control the behavior of the SIS application at the time of processing. 
    </p>

    <div class="bold margin-3">Clearing House Specific Details</div>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS allows view access to the Clearing House set-up details to the Users. This information can only be updated by the respective clearing house operations team members. 
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        2.3 USER SET-UP
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS platform allows different type of users to be configured in the system. Depending on the type of the user, the IS-WEB Menu structure and the Screens changes accordingly. The User profile details stored in SIS includes the name, location details, email id, contact number etc. of the person. The email id of the user acts as the login id for IS-WEB. IS provides a facility by which the email id of a User can be changed by the User if required.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS-Ops creates a Super User account once the participation formalities are completed. This Super User can create other users for their company. 
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        2.4 ASSIGN PERMISSIONS
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS Platform will assign the maximum permission allowed for a User to their Super User Account. The Super User, at the time of creating other users, can assign permissions to the users. These include permissions for viewing/editing information on a particular screen, permission to perform some special operations on specific screens, permission to create other users etc.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application will have default templates to assign permissions, which can be used by users to assign permissions. Users will also have the ability to create their own permission templates and apply them to their users.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application also provides a facility to copy the user permission profile from one user and replicate them on other users.
    </p>

    <p class="bold">
        3. DATA TRANSMISSION
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        All files to and from SIS will be processed initially by iiNet on behalf of SIS. Files will be received by iiNet from all Users, and will be transmitted by iiNet to the SIS application. Once the file is received correctly by iiNet, iiNet will complete delivery to the SIS application. Any files to be transmitted to a User will be sent by the SIS application to iiNet, and will be transmitted from iiNet to the User.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        Files from the User must be pushed to iiNet, and files from iiNet to the User may be pushed by iiNet or pulled by the User at the User’s choice.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        There are no fees for this service provided by iiNet for files transmitted from and to SIS, but usage will require separate acceptance of the iiNet Terms Of Use. Any added-value services provided by iiNet beyond transmission between the User and SIS are subject to iiNet’s normal terms and conditions, and fees may be applicable.
    </p>

    <p class="bold">
        4. RECEIVABLES PROCESSING
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application will process the incoming invoices and supporting documents provided by the billing entities.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        4.1 INVOICE DATA PROCESSING
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Input Possibilities
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application allows the billing entities to provide invoice information in an electronic formats (IS-XML).
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        Along with the electronic mode of invoice submission, SIS also provides a facility to manually capture and review invoice information online over the internet, named IS-WEB. The table below details the support provided by SIS for different type of transactions. 
    </p>

    <div class="regular-table regular-table-center no-page-break">
        <table style="width: 50%; margin-left: 20%;">
            <tr>
                <th>Transaction Types</th>
                <th>IS-XML</th>
                <th>IS-WEB</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Original Invoice</td>

                <td>X</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>-</td>
                <td>X</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p class="margin-3">
        On successful receipt of an incoming file, SIS generates a confirmation email and sends it to the billing entity. This email alert can be configured by billing entity using the User Profile screen on IS-WEB.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        In case of invoices captured over IS-WEB, SIS generates an email alert to the billing entity 24 hours before the billing period closure providing a list of open invoices yet to be submitted for further processing.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Data Validation
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Invoice data provided by the billing entities will be validated by SIS. This process will ensure that the invoice data is of good quality and the billed entities can process the same without any issue within their internal systems. This process will take place upon receipt of each SIS billing file.  
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        The different types of validation checks performed by the SIS application are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>File Construction checks: SIS will validate if the invoice files are created as per the defined file specifications, naming convention, duplicate files, compression logic, etc.</li>
            <li>Field Format checks: SIS will check if data values have been provided for mandatory data elements, conditionally mandatory data elements if the condition is met, etc. It will also ensure that the data is provided as per the field format (e.g. numeric, alphabetic, date, etc.) and as per the field length specifications (e.g. numeric field with a maximum of 5 digits)</li>
            <li>Reference Master checks: Invoice data fields having standard reference data values are valid (e.g. From City field if populated should have a valid IATA city/airport code, etc.)</li>
            <li>Interline Billing Rules checks: Some of the Interline billing rules defined in the RAM or ACH Manual of Procedure, such as possible duplicate billing check, outside time limit billings, minimum billing amount check for different type of transaction, etc.</li>
            <li>Settlement Information checks: SIS will validate the correctness of the Settlement details provided on the invoice if it needs to be cleared through a clearing house (e.g. Currency of Clearance information, Clearing House information, etc.).</li>
            <li>Billing Audit Trail checks: SIS will check if the various stages of billing are linked together and there are no out of turn billings (e.g. validation of ‘Previous Invoice number’, ‘Previous Billing Month’, ‘Previous Rejection number’, ‘Rejection Stage number’ in case of Rejections etc.)</li>
            <li>Computation checks: SIS will validate if billing amounts specified at various levels within the invoice add up together (e.g. the invoice total adds up to the sum of all Line Item totals, similarly Line Item total adds up to the sum of all Line Item details totals etc.). The total of the line items must not vary from the invoice value by more than a small tolerance.</li>
            <li>Legal Requirement checks: SIS will validate if certain legal requirements are satisfied by the Billing Entity in the invoice data (e.g. invoice Number is unique for a Billing User within a calendar year, VAT breakdown information is provided in the case that VAT amounts are billed in the invoice, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        Wherever possible, SIS will validate the entire file and identify all possible errors in the file. A validation report is generated at the end of this process and is provided to Billing Entity irrespective of the status of the validation. In case of errors, the Billing Entity can configure its User Profile to receive an email alerting its contact about the details of the Validation error.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        Invoice data captured using IS-WEB is validated at the time of data entry. SIS will alert the user in case invalid data in entered at the time of saving the information.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS Platform does not validate the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Whether the entity can legally bill the invoice through IS</li>
            <li>Whether the billed amounts are correct</li>
            <li>Whether all required taxes are applied correctly</li>
            <li>Whether all required legal information of all countries in the world is provided</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Error Handling
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        In case of validation error, SIS provides a facility to delete the erroneous invoices or the entire file through IS-WEB. For certain errors, SIS also provides an option of carrying out online correction on the IS-WEB. These correctable errors are errors related to reference data values such as invalid city/airport code, invalid tax code etc.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        Invoices in an error status are not considered for further processing by SIS.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        4.2 SUPPORTING DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Input Possibilities
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS provides the facility for billing entities to supply supporting documents in electronic format in both batch and as online modes. At the time of invoice capture, billing entities can manually upload the supporting documents. IS will store the uploaded supporting documents and link them to the invoice, or to the transaction within the invoice. 
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        IS supports 3 indexing options for submitting supporting documents in a batch mode. These are:
        <ul>
            <li>Using folder name based indexing</li>
            <li>Using a CSV file based indexing</li>
            <li>Using an XML file based indexing</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        The formats are explained in the IS-XML Structure and Interface Specification document.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        Billing entities can use any of the options to submit the batch supporting documents to IS.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        On successful receipt of a batch supporting file, IS generates a confirmation email and sends it to the billing entity. 
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Data Validation
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        IS carries out certain sanity checks on the batch supporting document file before it is considered for processing. The different type of checks includes the following:
        <ul>
            <li>File Construction checks: SIS will validate if the batch supporting documents files are created as per the defined file specifications, naming convention, duplicate files, compression logic, etc.</li>
            <li>Index Information checks: SIS will validate the index information supplied with the batch supporting documents files and confirm if it is as per the defined specification.</li>
            <li>File Extension checks: SIS will validate the file extensions of the individual supporting documents and check if it matches with one of the supported neutral file formats. In case it is not a neutral file format, SIS will validate if any exceptions for supporting document file types have been defined in the Member Profile of the billed entity for acceptance. If it is not an exception, SIS will delete the supporting document file from the system.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        Wherever possible, SIS will validate the entire file and identify all possible issues in the batch supporting document file. A validation report is generated at the end of this process and is provided to the billing entity.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Automated Linking of Supporting Documents
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application will carry out auto-linking of supporting documents provided in a batch mode to the corresponding billing record. This linking will be based on the Index information supplied in the batch supporting document file. Invoices which are successfully validated will be considered for automated linking. SIS will take care of any timing issues in case of automated linking if the supporting document file is provided prior to the invoice being successfully validated.
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        For cases where the SIS application is not able to automatically link the supporting documents, SIS provides a facility by which the billing entity can update the linking information on IS-WEB and manually trigger the linking process.

        4.3 DIGITAL SIGNATURE SERVICES
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        This is an optional service provided by the IS application. 
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Digital Signature Application
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS offers digital signature (DS) application service through a trusted digital signature service provider (currently <a href="https://www.trustweaver.com/">TrustWeaver</a>). Based on the instructions provided by the billing entity, SIS creates from the SIS-format invoice data an invoice subset file in PDF or XML format with the necessary legal and invoice information fields. This invoice subset file is forwarded to a trusted DS service provider in order to apply the appropriate digital signature. The file is sent immediately unless the file is incomplete (awaiting attachment). If there are attachments awaited, the file is not sent until all attachments have been uploaded and matched, or the billing deadline is reached, at which point the number of attachments reported is updated to reflect the number that are actually available at that time. The invoice is then sent for digital signature. After applying the digital signature, SIS receives the invoice subset file and stores it in its Central Repository. This digitally signed file is made available by SIS as one of the outputs to the billing entity at the end of the billing period, based on the configuration of the User Profile. The file can also be downloaded online over the IS-WEB.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        4.4 SETTLEMENT SERVICES
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application provides interfaces with industry clearing houses thus enabling automatic settlement of billed invoices as well as other clearing house related services.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Settlement Information
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application interfaces with two clearing houses: The IATA Clearing House (ICH) and the Airlines Clearing House (ACH). Based on the instructions provided by the billing entity, SIS generates a summary statement of the billed invoices and forwards it to the respective clearing house for settlement. In case of ICH, SIS generates claim files every 10 minutes whereas in case of ACH the settlement information is generated and passed only once at the billing period closure.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Suspended User Billing Management
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS supports billings from or against entities that continue in business but have been suspended from the clearing house. The billing entities can continue to send invoices to be routed through the clearing house or for bilateral settlement. In case of billing from/to suspended members involving ICH, SIS will flag the invoices as “Suspended” in the summary settlement statement and forward them to ICH. The ICH will record this information in accordance with its procedures. In the case of billing from/to suspended members involving ACH, SIS will not include such invoice details at the time of creating the summary settlement statement, and no record will be retained by the ACH. When creating the SIS-Format output (IS-XML or IS-WEB), SIS flags such invoices as “Suspended” and forwards them to the billed entity along with the other invoices.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        In case of re-instatement of the suspended member, SIS provides the functionality for the billing entities to re-submit their claims and settle through the clearing house any outstanding amounts that arose after suspension. SIS also provides a report which helps the billing entities to manage the invoice claims made during the suspension period.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        Handling Late Submission Billings
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS supports processing of invoices of closed billing periods for a short duration of time, immediately after the closure of the billing period. The designated person identified in the User Profile can request invoices to be considered for Late Submission. On acceptance of such request by the clearing house, the invoices will automatically be considered for settlement. Clearing houses may charge a fee for such submissions.

        <ul>
            <li>
                SIS-Format Invoice Files: IS groups the payable invoice information as per the Billed Entity and Billing Category level and generates invoice files as per the format requested by the billed entity.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        The Payable invoices can also be reviewed over IS-WEB.

        5.2 REJECTIONS OF INCOMING BILLINGS
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS enables rejection of incoming billings either via file upload using the IS-XML format, or by manual entry into the IS-WEB. Rejection processing can only take place once the Billing Output file has been received from SIS at the end of the clearance period. It is not possible to reject an incoming invoice in the same period as it was issued.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS application will check that rejections contain the required information, and will not permit rejections beyond the limits defined in the RAM or the ACH Manual of Procedure.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        Rejections are only possible while the billing or rejection to which it refers remains live in SIS for 6+2 months. 
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        5.3 PROCESS INVOICES ON IS-WEB 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        The SIS Platform allows Users to review the Payable invoice and transaction details on the IS-WEB. It also allows the user to view supporting documents linked to the invoice/transactions within the invoice. SIS maintains an audit trail of all invoices/ transactions within the platform so that the complete billing history of any invoice/ transaction can be viewed at any time. 
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS allows Rejection Invoices (known as Memos) to be raised weekly against Payable invoice transactions via the IS-WEB once received in the SIS outward file. The transaction details selected by the User when raising the Rejection Invoices/Memos are automatically carried forward thus reducing the data entry effort to some extent.

        6. CORRESPONDENCE MANAGEMENT
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Once a rejection for a billing has been entered, the entity which received the rejection can only continue the dispute by initiating correspondence. IS will not permit further re-billings unless the recipient has indicated their acceptance through the Correspondence process.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        6.1 GENERATE CORRESPONDENCE
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Once a rejection has been entered, the SIS application provides a facility by which the User who received the rejection, selects the rejection transaction/invoice on IS-WEB and initiates an electronic correspondence with the originator. The SIS application automatically populates the data in the correspondence screen based on the User Profile information. SIS automatically generates a correspondence reference number which remains the same until the end of the correspondence cycle. SIS provides an option to the User to attach supporting documents to the correspondence.
    </p> 

    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS provides a facility by which the user can save the correspondence in the draft stage and work on it later. SIS also provides a facility by which, if a user does not have the permission to send correspondence, can mark the correspondence as “Ready to Submit” and the supervisor can review, edit (if required) and send the correspondence. 
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        6.2 RECEIVE CORRESPONDENCE
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        When a correspondence is sent via SIS, an email notification is generated and is sent to the Correspondence Alert contact defined in the User Profile for the specific Billing Category. The email only contains a URL reference, which on clicking, will open up the IS-WEB Correspondence screen (note: it may be necessary for the user to modify their junk/spam filters to enable these communications to be viewed/actioned). On reading the correspondence if the User wants to continue with the correspondence process, IS provides a facility by which a reply correspondence is generated and the user is allowed to enter the details and send it to the interline partner.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        IS ensures that there is no out of turn correspondence done by the User.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        6.3 GRANT AUTHORITY TO BILL FOR CORRESPONDENCE
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS provides a facility where the User who received the correspondence can grant an Authority to Bill when responding to the received correspondence. If the issuer receiving the Authority to Bill is not satisfied with the amount for which the authority is granted, it can continue with the correspondence process and the Authority will be considered null and void. 
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        If the issuer receiving the authority to bill accepts the amount for which authority is granted, the User is expected to raise a Correspondence Invoice and claim the amount for which the authority is granted. SIS validates the amount of such Correspondence Invoices and matches it with the Authority amount. In case the two are not matching and the difference is more than the allowed tolerance, the invoice will fail in the Validation process.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        6.4 EXPIRY OF CORRESPONDENCE CASES
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS tracks the expiry dates of open correspondence cases in the system as per the rules defined in RAM/ACH Manual of Procedure. In case the party that initiated the correspondence does not respond to a received correspondence by the expiry of the time limit, the Correspondence case is closed by IS automatically with no further recourse through SIS for that particular case.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        Similarly if an Authority to Bill was granted and the User fails to raise the Correspondence Invoice by the expiry time limit, IS will close the correspondence case with no further recourse. 
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        In case the party who received the correspondence fails to respond to a received correspondence by the expiry time limit, SIS will mark the correspondence case as Expired. The User who caused the expiry will not be allowed to respond to the correspondence any further by SIS. The other party has the right to raise a Correspondence Invoice equal to the amount stated in the last correspondence sent which had expired. SIS validates the amount of such Correspondence Invoices and matches it with the amount of the last correspondence. In case the two are not matching and the difference is more than the allowed tolerance, the invoice will fail in the validation process.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        In the above case if the User fails to raise the Correspondence Invoice by the expiry time limit, SIS will close the correspondence case with no further recourse.

        1.1 This attachment describes the Additional Services that the User elects to use in addition to the provision of the Service under the main agreement. This annex may be amended at any time by the User and communicated to IATA in order to reflect the changes in its selection of Additional Services.

        3. OPTIONAL SERVICES
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        3.1 Digital Signature application
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS offers a digital signature (DS) application service in a number of countries with the help of a trusted digital signature service provider. Based on the instructions provided by the billing entity, SIS creates an invoice subset file from the SIS-format invoice data with the necessary legal and invoice information fields. This digitally signed file is made available by SIS as one of the outputs to the billing entity at the end of the billing period, based on the configuration of the Member Profile. It can also be downloaded online over the web portal.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS allows billed entities to configure the application of Digital Signature on Payable Invoices in the Member Profile. Based on the location details specified on the payable invoice, SIS triggers the process to apply digital signature in the countries covered by the service.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        3.2 Digital Signature verification 
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        SIS provides an option whereby the billed entity can request verification of the digital signature applied on Payable Invoices, via the Member Profile. A verification log file is created by this process which contains the status of the applied digital signature in the countries covered by the service. 
    </p>

    <p class="margin-3 bold">
        3.3 Legal Archiving (or E-Archiving) service
    </p>
    <p class="margin-3">
        Some jurisdictions may require legal storage for the digitally signed invoices for varying amounts of time. During this period, the invoices and any applicable digital signature need to be accessible for any audits. To address this issue, SIS will provide an optional Legal Archiving service to store the digitally signed invoices and other related information on behalf of the User in an external Legal archive for a longer period as required by the local regulations.

    <p class="margin-3">
        d) Fault categorization and resolution timelines
    </p>

    <p class="margin-6">
        1. IATA Help Desk will validate or determine the severity of the case based on the following definitions:
    </p>

    <p class="margin-6">
        <span class="bold">Showstoppers (Severity 1)</span>: Showstopper faults are those which prevent global use of the application software or which stop an operational function of application globally, thereby preventing the users from completing essential operations.  IATA will endeavour to provide a resolution, either in the form of a workaround or a patch in that order of priority, within six (6) hours. However, if more time is needed, this will be advised to the respective users. Once an alternative is provided or normal functioning of the application is instituted, the IATA Help Desk will inform the Users and the Showstopper will be considered resolved.
    </p>

    <p class="margin-6">
        The following will qualify as Showstopper faults:
        <ul class="margin-9">
            <li>Complete SIS platform is down</li>
            <li>Submission of billing data is not possible</li>
            <li>Settlement files cannot be created or are incorrect or do not arrive at their destination within the SIS perimeter</li>
            <li>Output billing files cannot be created or are incorrect or do not arrive at their destination within SIS perimeter</li>
            <li>Invoices cannot be digitally signed</li>
            <li>Invoices do not contain intended values, or referential integrity is compromised </li>
            <li>Billing data captured through the Web portal do not contain intended values, or referential integrity is compromised</li>
            <li>Processing times for files are greater than 2 hours max to load and validate files for non-peak loads and 4 hours max for peak loads.</li>
            <li>Response times for manual input are greater than 8 seconds for delivery of high complexity operation pages.</li>
            <li>Users unable to log on to SIS due to problems accessing the platform (excluding invalid/lost/expired logons)</li>
            <li>Security breach deemed to put SIS at risk.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="margin-6">
        <span class="bold">Major (Severity 2)</span>: Major defects are defined as those which impact a specific module within the system and for which workarounds are available, or prevent a non-core system process to be successfully completed. IATA will endeavour to provide a resolution, in the form of a workaround, within 1 Work Days (*). 
    </p>

    <p class="margin-6">
        In the context of SIS, the following will qualify as Major defects:
        <ul class="margin-9">
            <li>Web Analysis reports cannot be viewed / downloaded</li>
            <li>Alerts are not / incorrectly delivered</li>
            <li>Service usage report incorrectly produced by SIS application.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="margin-6">
        <span class="bold">Minor (Severity 3)</span>: These are faults where one or more functions in the application software are not working as normal or the SIS application’s behavior deviates from expected functionality, but these do not affect the operation. 
    </p>

    <p class="margin-6">
        <span class="bold">Trivial Defects (Severity 4)</span>: Trivial Defects are defined as those which do not affect the functionality of the SIS application and are cosmetic in nature. These will be addressed in future releases as per Section 2.3 in the SIS User Agreement.
    </p>
