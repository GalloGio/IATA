    <textOnly>Dear Product Owner,

This is a final notice to let you know that the validity date for your product #{!Product2.SAP_Material_Number__c} has expired. This is your last chance to change or extend your product’s Effective To date. Please perform one of the following actions:

Extend the Effective To date to a future period if you still wish to sell the remaining inventory
Should you not complete this action, the product will automatically be removed from the Online catalog tomorrow.


Best regards,
